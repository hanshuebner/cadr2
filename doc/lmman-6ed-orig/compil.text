.section The Basic Operations of the Compiler

	The purpose of the Lisp compiler is to convert Lisp functions
into programs in the Lisp Machine's instruction set, so that they
run more quickly and take up less storage.  Compiled functions
are represented in Lisp by FEFs (Function
Entry Frames), which contain machine code as well as various other information.
The printed representation of a FEF is
.lisp
#<DTP-FEF-POINTER 2address* 2name*>
.end_lisp

	If you want to understand the output of the compiler, refer
to (understanding-compiled-code).

.cindex QFASL files

	There are three ways to invoke the compiler from the Lisp
Machine.  First, you may have an interpreted function in the Lisp
environment that you would like to compile.  The function 3compile* is
used to do this.  Second, you may have code in an editor buffer that you
would like to compile.  The Zmacs editor has commands to read code into
Lisp and compile it.  Third, you may have a program (a group of function
definitions and other forms) written in a file on the file system.  The
function 3compile-file* can translate this file into a 2QFASL* file
that describes the compiled functions and associated data.  The QFASL
file format is capable of representing an arbitrary collection of Lisp
objects, including shared structure.  The name derives from `Q', a
prefix once used to mean ``for the Lisp Machine, not for Maclisp'', and
`FASL', an abbreviation for ``fast loading''.

.c Explain why the compiler expands macros.
.c Explain specialness versus localness, etc.

.section How to Invoke the Compiler

.defun compile function-spec &optional definition
Compiles an individual interpreted function definition.  If
2definition* is supplied, it is the definition to be compiled.
Otherwise, the current definition of 2function-spec* is used.  If
2function-spec* is non-3nil*, the compiled function is stored as the
definition of 2function-spec*, and 2function-spec* is returned.
Otherwise, the compiled function object itself is returned.
(However, it is preferable to use 3compile-lambda* if your wish
is to create a compiled function object without storing it anywhere.)

The compiled function object created by 3compile* records the
interpreted definition it was made from on its debugging info alist (see
(debugging-info-fun)).  This is useful in two ways: the function
3uncompile* can be used to reinstall the interpreted definition, and
3compile* invoked again on the same 2function-spec* can find the
interpreted definition used before and compile it again.  The latter is
useful if you have changed some macros or subst functions which the
definition refers to.
.end_defun

.defun uncompile function-spec
If 2function-spec* is defined as a compiled function that records the
original definition that was compiled, then 2function-spec* is redefined
with that original definition.  This undoes the effect of calling
3compile* on 2function-spec*.
.end_defun

.defun compile-lambda lambda-exp function-spec
Returns a compiled function object produced by compiling 2lambda-exp*.
The function name recorded by the compiled function object is
2function-spec*, but that function spec is not defined
by 3compile-lambda*.  This function is preferable to
3compile* with first argument 3nil* in that it allows you to
specify the name for the function to record internally.
.end_defun

.defun compile-encapsulations function-spec
Compiles all encapsulations that 3function-spec* currently has.
Encapsulations (see (encapsulate)) include tracing, breakons and
advice.  Compiling tracing or breakons makes it possible (or at least
more possible) to trace or breakon certain functions that are used in
the evaluator.  Compiling advice makes it less costly to advise
functions that are used frequently.

Any encapsulation that is changed will cease to be compiled; thus, if
you add or remove advice, you must do 3compile-encapsulations* again
if you wish the advice to be compiled again.
.end_defun

.defvar compile-encapsulations-flag
If this is non-3nil*, all encapsulations that are created are compiled
automatically.
.end_defvar

.defun compile-file input-file &key output-file set-default-pathname package
Compiles the file specified by 2input-file*, a pathname or namestring.
The format for files input to the compiler is described on
(compiler-input-section).

If 2output-file* is specified, it is a pathname used for the compiled file.
Otherwise, the ouptut file name is computed from the input file name
by specifying 3:qfasl* as the type component.

2package*, if non-3nil* specifies the package in which compilation
should be performed.  Normally the system knows, or asks interactively,
and you need not supply this argument.

2set-default-pathname*, if non-3nil*, means that the defaults
should be set to the input file's name.  2set-default-pathname* defaults to 3t*.
.end_defun

.defun qc-file filename &optional output-file load-flag in-core-flag package file-local-declarations dont-set-default-p read-then-process-flag
An older, obsolete way of invoking the compiler on a file.

2file-local-declarations* is for compiling multiple files as if they
were one.  2dont-set-default-p* suppresses the changing of the default
file name to 2filename* that normally occurs.  The 2load-flag* and
2in-core-flag* arguments were not fully implemented and should not be
used.  2read-then-process-flag* causes the entire file to be read and
then the entire file to be compiled; this is no longer advantageous now
that there is enough memory to avoid thrashing when forms are read and
compiled one by one, and it prevents compile-time reader-macros
defined in the file from working properly.
.end_defun

.defun qc-file-load filename &optional output-file load-flag in-core-flag package functions-defined file-local-declarations dont-set-default-p read-then-process-flag
Compiles a file and then loads in the resulting QFASL file.
.end_defun

.defvar compiler:compiler-verbose
If this variable is non-3nil*, the compiler prints the name of each
function that it is about to compile.
.end_defvar

.defvar compiler:peep-enable
The peephole optimizer is used if this variable is non-3nil*.
The only reason to set it to 3nil* is if there is a suspicion of a bug in the optimizer.
.end_defvar

See also the 3disassemble* function ((disassemble-fun)), which lists the instructions
of a compiled function in symbolic form.


.section Input to the Compiler
.setq compiler-input-section section-page
.cindex input to the compiler

	The purpose of 3compile-file* is to take a file and produce
a translated version which does the same thing as the original except
that the functions are compiled.  3compile-file* reads through the input
file, processing the forms in it one by one.  For each form, suitable
binary output is sent to the QFASL file so that when the QFASL file is
loaded the effect of that source form will be reproduced.  The differences
between source files and QFASL files are that QFASL files are in a compressed
binary form, which reads much faster but cannot be edited, and that
function definitions in QFASL files have been translated from Lisp forms
to FEFs.

	So, if the source contains a 3(defun ...)* form at top level,
then when the QFASL file is loaded the function will be defined as a
compiled function.  If the source file contains a form that is not of a
type known specially to the compiler, then that form (encoded in QFASL
format) is output ``directly'' into the QFASL file, so that when the
QFASL file is loaded that form will be evaluated.  Thus, if the source
file contains 3(princ "Hello")* at top level, then the compiler puts
in the QFASL file instructions to create the list 3(princ "Hello")*
and then evaluate it.

	The Lisp Machine editor Zmacs assumes that source files are
formatted so that an open parenthesis at the left margin (that is, in
column zero) indicates the beginning of a function definition or other top
level list (with a few standard exceptions).  The compiler assumes that you
follow this indentation convention, enabling it to tell when a
close-parenthesis is missing from one function as soon as the beginning of
the next function is reached.

	If the compiler finds an open parenthesis in column zero in the middle
of a list, it invents enough close parentheses to close off the list
that is in progress.  A compiler warning is produced instead of an
error.  After that list has been processed, the open parenthesis is read
again.  The compilation of the list that was forcefully closed off is
probably useless, but the compilation of the rest of the file is
usually correct.  You can read the source file into the editor to fix and
recompile the function that was unbalanced.

	A similar thing happens on end of file in the middle of a list, so
that you get to see any warnings for the function that was unbalanced.

	Certain special forms including 3eval-when*, 3progn*,
3local-declare*, 3declare-flavor-instance-variables*, and 3comment*
are customarily used around lists that start in column zero.  These symbols
have a non-3nil* 3si:may-surround-defun* property that makes the
compiler permit this.  You can add such properties to other symbols if you
want.

.defvar compiler:qc-file-check-indentation
If 3nil*, inhibits the compiler from checking for open-parentheses in
column zero.
.end_defvar

Whan a macro definition (3macro* and 3defmacro* forms) is
encountered at top level in the file being compiled, the macro
definition is recorded for the rest of the compilation so that the macro
thus defined can be used in the same file following its definition.
This is in addition to writing the compiled macro definition into the
QFASL file.

Flavor definitions (3defflavor* forms, see (defflavor-fun)) and
global 3special* declarations (made with 3proclaim*,
(proclaim-fun), or with 3defvar*, (defvar-fun)) are likewise
recorded for the rest of the compilation, as well as written into the
QFASL file so that they will be recorded permanently when the file is
loaded.

.defvar sys:file-local-declarations
During file-to-file compilation,
the value of this variable is a list of all declarations that are in
effect for the rest of the file.  Macro definitions, 3defdecl*'s,
3proclaim*'s
and special declarations that come from 3defvar*s are all recorded on
this list.
.end_defvar

Package-defining and altering functions such as 3defpackage*,
3in-package*, 3export* and 3use-package* are executed by the
compiler in the ordinary, permanent fashion.  They are also written in
the QFASL file so that the form is executed just the same when the file
is loaded.  If you load the file later in the same session, the package
altering form is executed twice.  This is normally harmless.
3require* receives the same treatment.

You can control explicitly whether a form is evaluated by the compiler,
and whether it is written into the QFASL file to be executed when the
file is loaded, using the 3eval-when* construct.  You might want a
form to be:
'cindex eval-when
.table 1 500
.item Put into the QFASL file (compiled, of course), or not.
.item Evaluated within the compiler, or not.
.item Evaluated if the source file loaded, or not.
.end_table

An 3eval-when* form looks like
.lisp
(eval-when 2times-list*
  2form1* 2form2* ...)
.end_lisp
The 2times-list* may contain one or more of the symbols 3load*, 3compile*,
or 3eval*.
If 3load* is present, the 2forms* are written into the QFASL file
to be evaluated when the QFASL file is loaded (except that 3defun* forms
put the compiled definition into the QFASL file instead).
If 3compile* is present, the 2forms* are evaluated in the compiler.
If 3eval* is present, the 2forms* are evaluated when read into Lisp;
this is because 3eval-when* is defined as a special form in Lisp.  (The
compiler ignores 3eval* in the 2times-list*.)
For example,
.lisp
(eval-when (compile eval) (macro foo (x) (cadr x)))
.end_lisp
would define 3foo* as a macro in the compiler and when the file
is read in interpreted, but not when the QFASL file is fasloaded.

.defspec eval-when (time...) body...
When seen by the interpreter, if one of the 2times* is the symbol 3eval*
then the 2body* forms are evaluated; otherwise 3eval-when* does nothing.

But when seen by the compiler, this special form does the special things described above.
.end_defspec

Nested use of 3eval-when* is permitted but its meaning is tricky.
If an inner 3eval-when* form appears in an ordinary context
where a general form would be written into the QFASL file but not
executed at compile time, then it behaves in the usual fashion:
the 2body* forms are written into the QFASL file if
3load* is one of the 2times*, and they are evaluated at
compile time if 3compile* is one of the 2times*.

If the inner 3eval-when* form appears in a context which says
to evaluate at compile time only, then the 2body* forms are
evaluated if 3eval* is one of the 2times*.

If the inner 3eval-when* appears in a context which says to
write into the QFASL file and evaluate at compile time,
the the 2body* forms are written into the QFASL file if
3load* is one of the 2times*, and they are evaluated at
compile time if either 3compile* or 3eval* is one of the 2times*.

	For the rest of this section, we will use lists such as are
given to 3eval-when*, e.g. 3(load eval)*, 3(load compile)*, etc.,
to describe when forms are evaluated.

	If a form is not enclosed in an 3eval-when*,
then the times at which it is evaluated depend on the form.
The following table summarizes at what times evaluation takes
place for any given form seen at top level by the compiler.
.table 3
.item (eval-when 2times-list* 2form* ...)
2times-list* specifies when the 2form*... should be performed.

.item (declare (special ...)) 1or* (declare (unspecial ...))
The 3special* or 3unspecial* is performed at
3(load compile)* time.

.item (declare 2anything-else*)
2anything-else* is performed only at
3(compile)* time.

.item (proclaim ...)
is performed at 3(load compile eval)* time.

'cindex special variable
.item (special ...) 1or* (unspecial ...)
3(load compile eval)*

.item (macro ...) 1or* (defmacro ...) 1or* (defsubst ...)
.item1 1or* (defflavor ...) 1or* (defstruct ...)
3(load eval)*.  However, during file to file compilation, the
definition is recorded temporarily and used for expanding calls
to the macro, or macros defined by the 3defstruct* for the
rest of the file.

.item (comment ...)
Ignored at all times.

.item (compiler-let ((2var val*) ...) 2body*...)
Processes the 2body* in its normal fashion, but with the indicated
variable bindings in effect.  These variables will typically
affect the operation of the compiler or of macros.  See (compiler-let-discussion).

.item (local-declare (2decl decl ...*) 2body*...)
Processes the 2body* in its normal fashion, with the indicated
declarations added to the front of the list which is the value
of 3local-declarations*.

.item (defun ...) 1or* (defmethod ...) 1or* (defselect ...)
3(load eval)*, but at load time what is processed is not this form
itself, but the result of compiling it.

.item (require ...) 1or* (in-package ...)
.item1 1or various other package functions*
3(load compile eval)*

.item 2anything-else*
3(load eval)*
.end_table

	Sometimes a macro wants to return more than one form
for the compiler top level to see (and to be evaluated).  The following
facility is provided for such macros.  If a form
.lisp
(progn 2form1* 2form2* ...)
.end_lisp
is seen at the compiler top level, all of the 2forms* are processed as if they had been at
compiler top level.  (Of course, in the interpreter they
are all evaluated.)

.need 4000
To prevent an expression from being optimized by the compiler,
surround it with a call to 3dont-optimize*.

.defspec dont-optimize form
In execution, this is equivalent to simply 2form*.  However, any
source-level optimizations that the compiler would normally perform on
the top level of 2form* are not done.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(dont-optimize (apply 'foo (list 'a 'b)))
.exdent 96 actually makes a list and calls 3apply*, rather than doing
(foo 'a 'b)

(dont-optimize (si:flavor-method-table flav))
.end_lisp
actually calls 3si:flavor-method-table* as a function, rather than
substituting the definition of that 3defsubst*.

3dont-optimize* can even be used around a 3defsubst* inside of
3setf* or 3locf*, to prevent open-coding of the 3defsubst*.
In this case, a function will be created at load time to do the
setting or return the location.
.lisp
(setf (dont-optimize (zwei:buffer-package buffer)) 
      (pkg-find-package "foo"))
.end_lisp

Subforms of 2form*, such as arguments, are still optimized or open
coded, unless additional 3dont-optimize*'s appear around them.
.end_defspec

.section Compile-Time Properties of Symbols

When symbol properties are referred to during macro expansion, it is
desirable for properties defined in a file to be ``in effect'' for the
the rest of the file if the file is compiled.  This does not happen if
3get* and 3defprop* are used, because the 3defprop* will not be
executed until the QFASL file is loaded.  Instead, you can use
3getdecl* and 3defdecl*.  These are normally the same as 3get* and
3defprop*, but during file-to-file compilation they also refer to and
create declarations.

.defun getdecl symbol property
This is a version of 3get* that allows the properties of
the 2symbol* to be overridden by declarations.

If a declaration of the form 3(2property* 2symbol* 2value*)* is
in effect, 3getdecl* returns 2value*.  Otherwise, 3getdecl*
returns the result of 3(get 2symbol* 2property*)*.

If you intend to create such declarations with 3proclaim*
or local use of 3declare*, you must make sure that
a 3declaration* declaration is in effect for 2property*.
You can do this with 3(proclaim '(declaration 2property*))*.

3getdecl* is typically used in macro definitions.
For example, the 3setf* macro uses 3getdecl* to get the
properties which say how to store in the specified place.
See (getdecl-example) for an example of a macro
that uses 3getdecl*.
.end_defun

.defun putdecl symbol property value
Causes 3(getdecl 2symbol* 2property*)* to return
2value*.

3putdecl* usually simply does a 3putprop*.  But if executed at
compile time during file-to-file compilation, it instead makes an entry
on 3file-local-declarations* of the form 3(2property* 2symbol*
2value*)*.

In either case, this stores 2value* where 3getdecl* can find it;
but if 3putdecl* is done during compilation, it affects only the
rest of that compilation.
.end_defun

.defspec defdecl symbol property value
When executed, this is like 3putdecl* except that the arguments
are not evaluated.  It is usually the same as 3defprop*
except for the order of the arguments.

Unlike 3defprop*, when 3defdecl* is encountered during file-to-file
compilation, a declaration is recorded which remains in
effect for the rest of the compilation.  (The 3defdecl* form also goes
into the QFASL file to be executed when the file is loaded).
3defprop* would have no effect whatever at compile time.

3defdecl* is often useful as a part of the expansion of a macro.
It is also useful as a top-level expression in a source file.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(defdecl foo locf foo-location)
.end_lisp
in a source file would allow 3(locf (foo 2args*...))*
to be used in the rest of that source file; and, once the file was
loaded, by anyone.

Simple use 3defsetf* expands into a 3defdecl*.
.end_defspec


.section Using Compiler Warnings
.cindex warnings from the compiler
.cindex compiler warnings

When the compiler prints warnings, it also records them in a data base,
organized by file and by function within file.  Old warnings for
previous compilations of the same function are thrown away, so the data
base contains only warnings that are still applicable.  This data base
can be
used to visit, in the editor, the functions that got warnings.  You can
also save the data base and restore it later.

There are three editor commands that you can use to begin visiting the
sites of the recorded warnings.  They differ only in how they decide
which files to look through:

.table 3 0 500
.item Meta-X Edit Warnings
For each file that has any warnings, asks whether to edit the warnings
for that file.

.item Meta-X Edit File Warnings
Reads the name of a file and then edits the warnings for that file.

.item Meta-X Edit System Warnings
Reads the name of a system and then 
edits the warnings for all files in that system (see 3defsystem*,
(defsystem-fun)).
.end_table

While the warnings are being edited, the warnings themselves appear in a
small window at the top of the editor frame, and the code appears in a
large window which occupies the rest of the editor frame.

As soon as you have finished specifying the file(s) or system to
process, the editor proceeds to visit the code for the first
warning.  From then on, to move to the next warning, use the command
3Control-Shift-W*.  To move to the previous warning, use
3Meta-Shift-W*.  You can also switch to the warnings window with
3Control-X O* or with the mouse, and move around in that buffer.
When you use 3Control-Shift-W* and there are no more warnings after
the cursor, you return to single-window mode.

You can also insert the text of the warnings into any editor buffer:
.table 3 0 500
.item Meta-X Insert File Warnings
Reads the name of a file and inserts into the buffer after point the
text for that file's warnings.  The mark is left after the warnings, but
the region is not turned on.

.item Meta-X Insert Warnings
Inserts into the buffer after point the text for the warnings of all
files that have warnings.  The mark is left after the warnings, but the
region is not turned on.
.end_table

You can also dump the warnings data base into a file and
reload it
later.  Then you can do 3Meta-X Edit Warnings* again in the later
session.  You dump the warnings with 3si:dump-warnings* and load the
file again with 3load*.  In addition, 3make-system* with the
3:batch* option writes all the warnings into a file in this way.

.defun si:dump-warnings output-file-pathname &rest warnings-file-pathnames
Writes the warnings for the files named in 2warnings-file-pathnames*
(a list of pathnames or strings) into a file named
2output-file-pathname*.
.end_defun

.defvar compiler:warn-on-errors
If this variable is non-3nil*, errors in reading code to be compiled,
and errors in macro expansion within the compiler, produce only
warnings; they do not enter the debugger.  The variable is normally
3t*.

The default setting is useful when you do not anticipate errors during
compilation, because it allows the compilation to proceed past such
errors.  If you have walked away from the machine, you do not come back
to find that your compilation stopped in the first file and did not
finish.

If you find an inexplicable error in reading or macroexpansion, and wish
to use the debugger to localize it, set 3compiler:warn-on-errors*
to 3nil* and recompile.
.end_defvar

.subsection Controlling Compiler Warnings

By controlling the compile-time values of the variables 3run-in-maclisp-switch*,
3obsolete-function-warning-switch*, and 3inhibit-style-warning-switch* (explained
above), you can enable or disable some of the warning messages of the compiler.
The following special form is also useful:

.defmac inhibit-style-warnings form
Prevents the compiler from performing style-checking on the top level
of 2form*.  Style-checking is still done on the arguments of 2form*.
Both obsolete function warnings and won't-run-in-Maclisp warnings are
done by means of the style-checking mechanism, so, for example,
.lisp
(setq bar (inhibit-style-warnings (value-cell-location foo)))
.end_lisp
does not warn that 3value-cell-location* will not work in Maclisp,
but
.lisp
(inhibit-style-warnings (setq bar (value-cell-location foo)))
.end_lisp
does warn, since 3inhibit-style-warnings* applies only to the top
level of the form inside it (in this case, to the 3setq*).
.end_defmac

Sometimes functions take arguments that they deliberately do not use.
Normally the compiler warns you if your program binds a variable that it
never references.  In order to disable this warning for variables that
you know you are not going to use, there are three things you can do.

.vindex ignore
.cindex ignored arguments
The first thing is to name the variables 3ignore* or 3ignored*.  The
compiler does not complain if a variable by one of these names is not
used.  Furthermore, by special dispensation, it is all right to have
more than one variable in a lambda-list that has one of these names.

Another thing you can do is write an 3ignore* declaration.  Example:
.lisp
(defun the-function (list fraz-name fraz-size)
  (declare (ignore fraz-size)))
.end_lisp
This has the advantage that 3arglist* (see (arglist-fun)) will return
a more meaningful argument list for the function, rather than returning
something with 3ignore*'s in it.

Finally, you can simply use the variable for effect
(ignoring its value) at the front of the function.  Example:
.lisp
(defun the-function (list fraz-name fraz-size)
  fraz-size       ; This argument is not used.
  ...)
.end_lisp

The following function is useful for requesting compiler warnings in
certain esoteric cases.  Normally, the compiler notices whenever any
function 2x* uses (calls) any other function 2y*; it makes notes of
all these uses, and then warns you at the end of the compilation if the
function 2y* got called but no definition of it has been seen.  This
usually does what you want, but sometimes there is no way the compiler
can tell that a certain function is being used.  Suppose that instead of
2x*'s containing any forms that call 2y*, 2x* simply stores 2y*
away in a data structure somewhere, and someplace else in the program
that data structure is accessed and 3funcall* is done on it.  There is
no way that the compiler can see that this is going to happen, and so it
can't notice the function usage, and so it can't create a warning
message.  In order to make such warnings happen, you can explicitly call
the following function at compile-time.

.defun compiler:function-referenced what by
2what* is a symbol that is being used as a function.  2by* may be any function spec.  
3compiler:function-referenced* must be
called at compile-time while a compilation is in progress.  It tells the
compiler that the function 2what* is referenced by 2by*.  When the compilation
is finished, if the function 2what* has not been defined, the compiler
issues a warning to the effect that 2by* referred to the function 2what*,
which was never defined.
.end_defun

You can also tell the compiler about any function it should consider
``defined'':

.defun compiler:compilation-define function-spec
2function-spec* is marked as ``defined'' for the sake of the compiler;
future calls to this function will not produce warnings.
.end_defun

.defmac compiler:make-obsolete function reason
This special form declares a function to be obsolete; code that calls it
will get a compiler warning, under the control of 3obsolete-function-warning-switch*.
This is used by the compiler to mark as obsolete some Maclisp functions which exist in
Zetalisp but should not be used in new programs.  It can also
be useful when maintaining a large system, as a reminder that a function has
become obsolete and usage of it should be phased out.  An example of an
obsolete-function declaration is:
.lisp
(compiler:make-obsolete create-mumblefrotz
	"use MUMBLIFY with the :FROTZ option instead")
.end_lisp
.end_defmac

.subsection Recording Warnings

The warnings data base is not just for compilation.  It can record
operations for any number of different operations on files or parts of
files.  Compilation is merely the only operation in the system that uses it.

Each operation about which warnings can be recorded should have a name,
preferably in the keyword package.  This symbol should have four
properties that tell the system how to print out the operation name
as various parts of speech.  For compilation, the operation name is
3:compile* and the properties are defined as follows:

.lisp
(defprop :compile "compilation" si:name-as-action)
(defprop :compile "compiling" si:name-as-present-participle)
(defprop :compile "compiled" si:name-as-past-participle)
(defprop :compile "compiler" si:name-as-agent)
.end_lisp

The warnings system considers that these operations are normally
performed on files that are composed of named objects.  Each warning is
associated with a filename and then with an object within the file.
It is also possible to record warnings about objects that are not within
any file.

To tell the warnings system that you are starting to process all or part
of a file, use the macro 3si:file-operation-with-warnings*.

.defmac sys:file-operation-with-warnings (generic-pathname operation-name whole-file-p) body...
2body* is executed within a context set up so that warnings can be
recorded for operation 2operation-name* about the file specified by
2generic-pathname* (see (pathname-generic-pathname-method)).

In the case of compilation, this is done at the level of 3compile-file*
(actually, it is done in 3compiler:compile-stream*).

2whole-file-p* should be non-3nil* if the entire contents of the
file are to be processed inside the 2body* if it finishes; this implies
that any warnings left over from previous iterations of this operation
on this file should be thrown away on exit.  This is only relevant to
objects that are not found in the file this time; the assumption is that
the objects must have been deleted from the file and their warnings are
no longer appropriate.

All three of the special arguments are specified as expressions that
are evaluated.
.end_defmac

Within the processing of a file, you must also announce when you are
beginning to process an object:

.defmac sys:object-operation-with-warnings (object-name location-function) body...
Executes 2body* in a context set up so that warnings are recorded
for the object named 2object-name*, which can be a symbol or a list.
Object names are compared with 3equal*.

In the case of compilation, this macro goes around the processing of a
single function.

2location-function* is either 3nil* or a function that the editor
uses to find the text of the object.  Refer to the file 3SYS: ZWEI; POSS
LISP* for more details on this.

2object-name* and 2location-function* are specified with expressions
that are evaluated.

You can enter this macro recursively.  If the inner invocation is for
the same object as the outer one, it has no effect.  Otherwise, warnings
recorded in the inner invocation apply to the object specified therein.
.end_defmac

Finally, when you detect exceptions, you must make the actual warnings:

.defun sys:record-warning type severity location-info format-string &rest args
Records one warning for the object and file currently being processed.
The text of the warning is specified by 2format-string*and 2args*,
which are suitable arguments for 3format*, but the warning is 2not*
printed when you call this function.  Those arguments will be used to
reprint the warning later.

.defun1 sys:record-and-print-warning type severity location-info format-string &rest args
Records a warning and also prints it.

2type* is a symbol that identifies the specific cause of the warning.
Types have meaning only as defined by a particular operation, and at
present nothing makes much use of them.  The system defines one type:
3si:premature-warnings-marker*.

2severity* measures how important a warning this is, and the general
causal classification.  It should be a symbol in the keyword package.
Several severities are defined, and should be used when appropriate,
but nothing looks at them:
.table 3
.item :implausible
This warning is about something that is not intrinsically wrong but is
probably due to a mistake of some sort.

.item :impossible
This warning is about something that cannot have a meaning
even if circumstances outside the text being processed are
changed.

.item :probable-error
This is used to indicate something that is certainly an error
but can be made correct by a change somewhere else; for example, calling
a function with the wrong number of arguments.

.item :missing-declaration
This is used for warnings about free variables not declared special,
and such.  It means that the text was not actually incorrect, but
something else that is supposed to accompany it was missing.

.item :obsolete
This warning is about something that you shouldn't use any more,
but which still does work.

.item :very-obsolete
This is about something that doesn't even work any more.

.item :maclisp
This is for something that doesn't work in Maclisp.

.item :fatal
This indicates a problem so severe that no sense can be made of the
object at all.  It indicates that the presence or absence of other
warnings is not significant.

.item :error
There was a Lisp error in processing the object.
.end_table

2location-info* is intended to be used to inform the editor of the
precise location in the text of the cause of this warning.  It is not
defined as yet, and you should use 3nil*.
.end_defun

If a warning is encountered while processing data that doesn't really
have a name (such as forms in a source file that are not function
definitions), you can record a warning even though you are not inside
an invocation of 3sys:object-operation-with-warnings*.  This
warning is known as a 2premature warning* and it will be recorded with
the next object that is processed; a message will be added so that the
user can tell which warnings were premature.

Refer to the file 3SYS: SYS; QNEW LISP* for more information on the
warnings data base.

.section Compiler Source-Level Optimizers
'cindex optimizer, compiler

The compiler stores optimizers for source code on property lists so as
to make it easy for the user to add them.  An optimizer can be used to
transform code into an equivalent but more efficient form (for
example, 3(eq 2obj* nil)* is transformed into 3(null 2obj*)*,
which can be compiled better).  An optimizer can also be used to
tell the compiler how to compile a special form.  For example,
in the interpreter 3do* is a special form, implemented by a function
which takes quoted arguments and calls 3eval*.  In the compiler,
3do* is expanded in a macro-like way by an optimizer into
equivalent Lisp code using 3prog*, 3cond*, and 3go*, which
the compiler understands.

The compiler finds the optimizers to apply to a form by looking for
the 3compiler:optimizers* property of the symbol that is the
car of the form.  The value of this property should be a list of
optimizers, each of which must be a function of one argument.  The
compiler tries each optimizer in turn, passing the form to be
optimized as the argument.  An optimizer that returns the original
form unchanged (3eq* to the argument) has ``done nothing'', and
the next optimizer is tried.  If the optimizer returns anything else,
it has ``done something'', and the whole process starts over again.

Optimizers should not be used to define new language features, because
they only take effect in the compiler; the interpreter (that is, the
evaluator) doesn't know about optimizers.  So an optimizer should not
change the effect of a form; it should produce another form that does
the same thing, possibly faster or with less memory or something.  That
is why they are called optimizers.  In principle, the code ought to
compile just as correctly if the optimizer is eliminated.

.defmac compiler:add-optimizer function optimizer optimized-into...
Puts 2optimizer* on 2function*'s optimizers list if it isn't there already.
2optimizer* is the name of an optimization function, and 2function*
is the name of the function calls which are to be processed.  Neither
is evaluated.

3(compiler:add-optimizer 2function* 2optimizer* 2optimize-into-1*
2optimize-into-2...*)* also remembers 2optimize-into-1*, etc., as
names of functions which may be called in place of 2function* as a
result of the optimization.  Then 3who-calls* of 2function* will
also mention callers of 2optimize-into-1*, etc.
.end_defmac

.defmac compiler:defoptimizer function optimizer-name (optimizes-into...) lambda-list body...
Defines an optimizer and installs it.  Equivalent to
.lisp
(progn
  (defun 2optimizer-name* 2lambda-list*
    2body*...)
  (compiler:add-optimizer 2function* 2optimizer-name*
			  2optimizes-into*...))
.end_lisp
.end_defmac

.defmac compiler:defcompiler-synonym function for-function
Makes 2function* a synonym for 2for-function* in code being compiled.
Example:
.lisp
(compiler:defcompiler-synonym plus +)
.end_lisp
is how the compiler is told how to compile 3plus*.
.end_defmac

.section Maclisp Compatibility

Certain programs are intended to be run both in Maclisp and in
Zetalisp.  Their source files need some special conventions.  For
example, all 3special* declarations must be enclosed in 3declare*'s,
so that the Maclisp compiler will see them.  The main issue is that many
functions and special forms of Zetalisp do not exist in
Maclisp.  It is suggested that you turn on 3run-in-maclisp-switch* in
such files, which will warn you about a lot of problems that your program
may have if you try to run it in Maclisp.

The macro-character combination 3#+lispm* causes the object that
follows it to be visible only when compiling for Zetalisp.  The
combination 3#+maclisp* causes the following object to be visible only
when compiling for Maclisp.  These work both on subexpressions of the
objects in the file and at top level in the file.  To conditionalize
top-level objects, however, it is better to put the macros
3if-for-lispm* and 3if-for-maclisp* around them.  The
3if-for-lispm* macro turns off 3run-in-maclisp-switch* within its
object, preventing spurious warnings from the compiler.  The 3#+lispm*
reader construct does not dare do this, since it can be used to conditionalize
any object, not just a expression that will be evaluated.

To allow a file to detect what environment it is being compiled in,
the following macros are provided:

.defmac if-for-lispm form
If 3(if-for-lispm 2form*)* is seen at the top level of
the compiler, 2form* is passed to the compiler top level if
the output of the compiler is a QFASL file intended for Zetalisp.
If the Zetalisp interpreter sees this it evaluates 2form*
(the macro expands into 2form*).
.end_defmac

.defmac if-for-maclisp form
If 3(if-for-maclisp 2form*)* is seen at the top level of
the compiler, 2form* is passed to the compiler top level if
the output of the compiler is a FASL file intended for Maclisp
(e.g. if the compiler is COMPLR).
If the Zetalisp interpreter ignores this form entirely
(the macro expands into 3nil*).
.end_defmac

.defmac if-for-maclisp-else-lispm maclisp-form lispm-form
If 3(if-for-maclisp-else-lispm 2form1* 2form2*)* is seen at the top level of
the compiler, 2form1* is passed to the compiler top level if
the output of the compiler is a FASL file intended for Maclisp;
otherwise 2form2* is passed to the compiler top level.
.end_defmac

.defmac if-in-lispm form
In Zetalisp, 3(if-in-lispm 2form*)* causes 2form*
to be evaluated; in Maclisp, 2form* is ignored.
.end_defmac

.defmac if-in-maclisp form
In Maclisp, 3(if-in-maclisp 2form*)* causes 2form*
to be evaluated; in Zetalisp, 2form* is ignored.
.end_defmac

	In order to make sure that those macros are
defined when reading the file into the Maclisp compiler, you must
make the file start with a prelude, which should look like:
.lisp
(eval-when (compile)
  (cond ((not (status feature lispm))
               (load '|PS:<L.SYS2>CONDIT.LISP|))))
		;; Or other suitable filename
.end_lisp
This does nothing when you compile the program on the Lisp Machine.
If you compile it with the Maclisp compiler, it loads in definitions
of the above macros, so that they will be available to your
program.  The form 3(status feature lispm)* is generally useful in
other ways; it evaluates to 3t* when evaluated on the Lisp Machine and
to 3nil* when evaluated in Maclisp.

There are some advertised variables whose compile-time values affect the
operation of the compiler.  Mostly these are for Maclisp compatibility
features.  You can set these variables by including in his file
forms such as
.lisp
(eval-when (compile) (setq open-code-map-switch t))
.end_lisp
However, these variables seem not to be needed very often.

.defvar run-in-maclisp-switch
If this variable is non-3nil*, the compiler tries to warn the
user about any constructs that will not work in Maclisp.  By no means
all Lisp Machine system functions not built in to Maclisp
cause warnings;  only those that could not be written by the user
in Maclisp (for example, 3make-array*, 3value-cell-location*, etc.).
Also, lambda-list keywords such as
3&optional* and initialized 3prog* variables are be
mentioned.  This switch also inhibits the warnings for obsolete Maclisp functions.
The default value of this variable is 3nil*.
.end_defvar

.defvar obsolete-function-warning-switch
If this variable is non-3nil*, the compiler tries to warn
the user whenever an obsolete Maclisp-compatibility function such as
3maknam* or 3samepnamep* is used.  The default value is 3t*.
.end_defvar

.defvar allow-variables-in-function-position-switch
If this variable is non-3nil*, the compiler allows the use of
the name of a variable in function position to mean that the
variable's value should be 3funcall*'ed.  This is for compatibility
with old Maclisp programs.  The default value of this variable is
3nil*.
.end_defvar

.defvar open-code-map-switch
If this variable is non-3nil*, the compiler attempts
to produce inline code for the mapping functions (3mapc*, 3mapcar*, etc.,
but not 3mapatoms*) if the function being mapped is an anonymous
lambda-expression.
The generated code is faster but larger.  The default value is 3t*.

If you want to turn off open coding of these functions,
It is preferable to use 3(declare (notinline mapc mapcar ...))*.
.end_defvar

.defvar inhibit-style-warnings-switch
If this variable is non-3nil*, all compiler style-checking is
turned off.  Style checking is used to issue obsolete function
warnings, won't-run-in-Maclisp warnings, and other sorts of
warnings.  The default value is 3nil*.  See also the
3inhibit-style-warnings* macro, which acts on one level only of an
expression.
.end_defvar

.defmac compiler-let ((variable value)...) body...
Allows local rebinding
of global switches that affect either compilation or the behavior
of user-written macros.  Its syntax is like that of 3let*, and
in the interpreter it is identical to 3let*.
When encountered in compiled code, the variables are bound
around the compilation of 2body* rather than around
the execution at a later time of the compiled code for 2body*.
For example,
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(compiler-let ((open-code-map-switch nil))
  (mapc (function (lambda (x) ...)) foo))
.end_lisp
prevents the compiler from open-coding the 3mapc*.

The same results can be obtained more cleanly using 3declare*.
User-written macros can examine the declarations using 3getdecl*.
.end_defmac

.nopara
The next three functions are primarily for Maclisp compatibility.  In
Maclisp, they are declarations, used within a 3declare* at top level
in the file.

.defspec *expr symbol...
Declares each 2symbol*
to be the name of a function.  In addition it prevents these functions from appearing
in the list of functions referenced but not defined, printed at the end of the compilation.
.end_defspec

.defspec *lexpr symbol...
Declares each 2symbol*
to be the name of a function.  In addition it prevents these functions from appearing
in the list of functions referenced but not defined, printed at the end of the compilation.
.end_defspec

.defspec *fexpr symbol...
Declares each 2symbol*
to be the name of a special form.  In addition it prevents these names from appearing
in the list of functions referenced but not defined, printed at the end of the compilation.
.end_defspec

.section Putting Data in QFASL Files
.cindex fasdump
.setq fasdump section-page

It is possible to make a QFASL file containing data, rather than a
compiled program.  This can be useful to speed up loading of a data
structure into the machine, as compared with reading in printed
representations.  Also, certain data structures such as arrays do not
have a convenient printed representation as text, but can be saved in
QFASL files.  For example, the system stores fonts this way.  Each
font is in a QFASL file (on the 3SYS: FONTS;* directory) that
contains the data structures for that font.  When the file is loaded,
the symbol that is the name of the font gets set to the array that
represents the font.  Putting data into a QFASL file is often
referred to as ``2fasdumping* the data''.

In compiled programs, the constants are saved in the QFASL file in this way.
The compiler optimizes by making constants that are 3equal* become 3eq*
when the file is loaded.  This does not happen when you make a data file yourself;
identity of objects is preserved.  Note that when a QFASL file is loaded,
objects that were 3eq* when the file was written are still 3eq*; this does not
normally happen with text files.

The following types of objects can be represented in QFASL files:
Symbols (uninterned or uninterned), numbers of all kinds, lists,
strings, arrays of all kinds, named structures, instances, and FEFs.

.defmetamethod instances :fasd-form
When an instance is fasdumped (put into a QFASL file), it is sent a 3:fasd-form*
message, which must return a Lisp form that, when evaluated, will recreate the
equivalent of that instance.  This is because instances are often part of a large
data structure, and simply fasdumping all of the instance variables and making
a new instance with those same values is unlikely to work.  Instances remain
3eq*; the 3:fasd-form* message is only sent the first time a particular instance
is encountered during writing of a QFASL file.  If the instance does
not accept the 3:fasd-form* message, it cannot be fasdumped.
.end_defmetamethod

Loading a QFASL file in which a named structure has been fasdumped
creates a new named structure with components identical to those of the
one that was dumped.  Then the 3:fasd-fixup* operation is invoked,
which gives the new structure the opportunity to correct its contents if
they are not supposed to be just the same as what was dumped.

The meaning of a QFASL file is greatly affected by the package used
for loading it.  Therefore, the file itself says which package to use.

In 3dump-forms-to-file*, you can specify the package to use by
including a 3:package* attribute in the 2attribute-list* argument.
For example, if that argument is the list 3(:package "SI")* then the
file is dumped and loaded in the 3si* package.  If the package is not
specified in this way, 3user* is used.  The other fasdumping functions
always use 3user*.

.defun dump-forms-to-file filename forms-list &optional attribute-list
Writes a QFASL file named 2filename* which contains, in effect, the
forms in 2forms-list*.  That is to say, when the file is loaded, its
effect will be the same as evaluating those forms.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(dump-forms-to-file "foo" '((setq x 1) (setq y 2)))
(load "foo")
x => 1
y => 2
.end_lisp

2attribute-list* is the file attribute list to store in the QFASL
file.  It is a list of
alternating keywords and values, and corresponds to the 3-*-* line of a source file.
The most useful keyword in this context is 3:package*, whose value in the
attribute list specifies the package to be used both in dumping the forms and in
loading the file.  If no 3:package* keyword is present, the file will be loaded in
whatever package is current at the time.
.end_defun

.defun compiler:fasd-symbol-value filename symbol
Writes a QFASL file named 2filename* which contains the value of 2symbol*.
When the file is loaded, 2symbol* will be 3setq*'ed to the same value.
2filename* is parsed and defaulted with the default pathname defaults.
The file type defaults to 3:qfasl*.
.end_defun

.defun compiler:fasd-font name
Writes the font named 2name* into a QFASL file with the appropriate name
(on the 3SYS: FONTS;* directory).
.end_defun

.defun compiler:fasd-file-symbols-properties filename symbols properties dump-values-p dump-functions-p new-symbol-function
This is a way to dump a complex data structure into a QFASL file.  The values,
the function definitions, and some of the properties of certain symbols are put into
the QFASL file in such a way that when the file is loaded the symbols will
be 3setq*ed, 3fdefine*d, and 3putprop*ped appropriately.  The user can
control what happens to symbols discovered in the data structures being fasdumped.

2filename* is the name of the file to be written.  It is defaulted
with the default pathname defaults.  The file type
defaults to 3"QFASL"*.

2symbols* is a list of symbols to be processed.  2properties* is a list
of properties which are to be fasdumped if they are found on the symbols.
2dump-values-p* and 2dump-functions-p* control whether the values and
function definitions are also dumped.

2new-symbol-function* is called whenever a new symbol is found in the
structure being dumped.  It can do nothing, or it can add the symbol to the
list to be processed by calling 3compiler:fasd-symbol-push*.  The value
returned by 2new-symbol-function* is ignored.
.end_defun

.section Analyzing QFASL Files

QFASL files are composed of 16-bit nibbles.  The first two nibbles in
the file contain fixed values, which are there so the system can tell a
proper QFASL file.  The next nibble is the beginning of the first
2group*.  A group starts with a nibble that specifies an operation.
It may be followed by other nibbles that are arguments.

Most of the groups in a QFASL file are there to construct objects when
the file is loaded.  These objects are recorded in the 2fasl-table*.
Each time an object is constructed, it is assigned the next sequential
index in the fasl-table.  The indices are used by other groups later in
the file, to refer back to objects already constructed.

To prevent the fasl-table from becoming too large, the QFASL file
can be divided into 2whacks*.  The fasl-table is cleared out at the
beginning of each whack.

The other groups in the QFASL file perform operations such as
evaluating a list previously constructed or storing an object into a
symbol's function cell or value cell.

If you are having trouble with a QFASL file and want to find out exactly
what it does when it is loaded, you can use UNFASL to find out.

.defun si:unfasl-print input-file-name
Prints on 3*standard-output** a description of the contents of the QFASL
file 2input-file-name*.
.end_defun

.defun si:unfasl-file input-file-name &optional output-file-name
Writes a description of the contents of the QFASL file
2input-file-name* into the output file.  The output file type defaults
to 3:unfasl* and the rest of the pathname defaults from
2input-file-name*.
.end_defun
