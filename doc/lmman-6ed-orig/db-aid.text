.section Tracing Function Execution
.cindex tracing function execution
.setq trace section-page

	The trace facility allows the user to 2trace* some functions.
When a function is traced, certain special actions are taken when it is
called and when it returns.  The default tracing action is to print a message when the
function is called, showing its name and arguments, and another message when
the function returns, showing its name and value(s).

	The trace facility is closely compatible with Maclisp.  You invoke
it through the 3trace* and 3untrace* special forms, whose syntax is described
below.  Alternatively, you can use the trace system by clicking 3Trace*
in the system menu, or by using the 3Meta-X Trace* command in the editor.
This allows you to select the trace options from a menu instead of having
to remember the following syntax.

.defspec trace
A 3trace* form looks like:
.lisp
(trace 2spec-1* 2spec-2* ...)
.end_lisp

Each 2spec* can take any of the following forms:
.table 1
.item a symbol
This is a function name, with no options.  The function is traced in the
default way, printing a message each time it is called and each time it returns.

.item a list 3(2function-name* 2option-1* 2option-2* ...)*
2function-name* is a symbol and the 2options* control how it is to be
traced.  The various options are listed below.  Some options take arguments,
which should be given immediately following the option name.

.item a list 3(:function 2function-spec* 2option-1* 2option-2* ...)*
This is like the previous form except that 2function-spec* need not be a symbol
(see (function-spec)).
It exists because if 2function-name* was a list in the previous form, it
would instead be interpreted as the following form:

.item a list 3((2function-1* 2function-2*...) 2option-1* 2option-2* ...)*
All of the functions are traced with the same options.  Each 2function* can
be either a symbol or a general function-spec.
.end_table
.end_defspec

	The following 3trace* options exist:
.table 3 0 1500
.item :break 2pred*
'kindex :break trace
Causes a breakpoint to be entered after printing
the entry trace information but before applying the traced function to its
arguments, if and only if 2pred* evaluates to non-3nil*.  During the
breakpoint, the symbol 3arglist* is bound to a list of the arguments
of the function.

.item :exitbreak 2pred*
'kindex :exitbreak trace
This is just like 3break* except that the
breakpoint is entered after the function has been executed and the exit trace information
has been printed, but before control returns.    During the
breakpoint, the symbol 3arglist* is bound to a list of the arguments
of the function, and the symbol 3values* is bound to a list of
the values that the function is returning.

.item :error
'kindex :error trace
Causes the error handler to be called when the function is entered.  Use
3Resume* (or 3Control-C*) to continue execution of the function.  If this option
is specified, there is no printed trace output other than the error message
printed by the error handler.  This is semi-obsolete, as 3breakon* is
more convenient and does more exactly the right thing.

.item :step
'kindex :step trace
Causes the function to be single-stepped whenever it is called.
See the documentation on the step facility, (stepper-section).

.item :stepcond 2pred*
'kindex :stepcond trace
Causes the function to be single-stepped
only if 2pred* evaluates to non-3nil*.

.item :entrycond 2pred*
'kindex :entrycond trace
Causes trace information to be printed on function
entry only if 2pred* evaluates to non-3nil*.

.item :exitcond 2pred*
'kindex :exitcond trace
Causes trace information to be printed on function
exit only if 2pred* evaluates to non-3nil*.

.item :cond 2pred*
'kindex :cond trace
This specifies both 3:exitcond* and 3:entrycond*
together.

.item :wherein 2function*
'kindex :wherein trace
Causes the function to be traced only when called, directly or indirectly,
from the specified function 2function*.  One can give several trace specs to
3trace*, all specifying the same function but with different 3wherein*
options, so that the function is traced in different ways when called from
different functions.

This is different from 3advise-within*, which only affects the function
being advised when it is called directly from the other function.  The 3trace*
3:wherein* option means that when the traced function is called, the special
tracing actions occur if the other function is the caller of this function,
or its caller's caller, or its caller's caller's caller, etc.

.item :argpdl 2pdl*
'kindex :argpdl trace
Specifies a symbol 2pdl*, whose value is
initially set to 3nil* by 3trace*.  When the function is traced, a
list of the current recursion level for the function, the function's
name, and a list of arguments is consed onto the 2pdl* when the
function is entered, and cdr'ed back off when the function is exited.
The 2pdl* can be inspected from within a breakpoint, for example, and
used to determine the very recent history of the function. This option
can be used with or without printed trace output.  Each function can be
given its own pdl, or one pdl may serve several functions.

.item :entryprint 2form*
'kindex :entryprint trace
The 2form* is evaluated and the value is included in the trace message
for calls to the function.  You can give this option multiple times,
and all the 2form*'s thus specified are evaluated and printed.
3\\* precedes the values to separate them from the arguments.

.item :exitprint 2form*
'kindex :exitprint trace
The 2form* is evaluated and the value is included in the trace message
for returns from the function.  You can give this option multiple times,
and all the 2form*'s thus specified are evaluated and printed.
3\\* precedes the values to separate them from the returned values.

.item :print 2form*
'kindex :print trace
The 2form* is evaluated and the value is included in the trace messages
for both calls to and returns from the function.  Equivalent to
3:exitprint* and 3:entryprint* at once.

.item :entry 2list*
'kindex :entry trace
This specifies a list of arbitrary forms whose
values are to be printed along with the usual entry-trace.  The list of
resultant values, when printed, is preceded by 3\\* to separate it
from the other information.

.item :exit 2list*
'kindex :exit trace
This is similar to 3entry*, but specifies expressions
whose values are printed with the exit-trace.  Again, the list of
values printed is preceded by 3\\*.

.item :arg  :value  :both  nil
'kindex :arg trace
'kindex :value trace
'kindex :both trace
These specify which of the usual trace
printouts should be enabled.  If 3:arg* is specified, then on function
entry the name of the function and the values of its arguments will be
printed.  If 3:value* is specified, then on function exit the returned
value(s) of the function will be printed.  If 3:both* is specified,
both of these will be printed.  If 3nil* is specified, neither will
be printed.  If none of these four options are specified the default is
to 3:both*.  If any further 2options* appear after one of these,
they are not treated as options!  Rather, they are considered to
be arbitrary forms whose values are to be printed on entry and/or exit
to the function, along with the normal trace information. The values
printed will be preceded by a 3//*, and follow any values specified
by 3:entry* or 3:exit*.

Note that since these options ``swallow'' all
following options, if one is given it should be the last option
specified.
.end_table

.vindex arglist
In the evaluation of the expression arguments to various 3trace* options
such as 3:cond* and 3:break*, the value of 3arglist* is
a list of the arguments given to the traced function.  Thus
.lisp
(trace (foo :break (null (car arglist))))
.end_lisp
would cause a break in 3foo* if and only if the first argument to
3foo* is 3nil*.  If the 3:break* option is used, the variable
3arglist* is valid inside the break-loop.  If you 3setq* 3arglist*
before actual function execution, the arguments seen by the function
will change.

.vindex values
In the evaluation of the expression arguments to various 3trace* options
such as 3:cond* and 3:break* on exit from the traced function,
the variable 3values* is bound to a
list of the resulting values of the traced function.
If the 3:exitbreak* option is used, the variables 3values* and 3arglist* 
are valid inside the break-loop.  If you 3setq* 3values*, the values returned
by the function will change.

The trace specifications may be ``factored'', as explained above.  For example,
.lisp
(trace ((foo bar) :break (bad-p arglist) :value))
1is equivalent to*
(trace (foo :break (bad-p arglist) :value)
       (bar :break (bad-p arglist) :value))
.end_lisp
Since a list as a function name is interpreted as a list of
functions, non-atomic function names (see (function-spec))
are specified as follows:
.lisp
(trace (:function (:method flavor :message) :break t))
.end_lisp

3trace* returns as its value a list of names of all functions it traced.  If
called with no arguments, as just 3(trace)*, it returns a list of all the
functions currently being traced.

If you attempt to trace a function already being traced, 3trace* calls
3untrace* before setting up the new trace.

Tracing is implemented with encapsulation (see (encapsulate)), so if the
function is redefined (e.g. with 3defun* or by loading it from a QFASL file)
the tracing will be transferred from the old definition to the new definition.

Tracing output is printed on the stream that is the value of 3*trace-output**.
This is synonymous with 3*terminal-io** unless you change it.

.defspec untrace
Undoes the effects of 3trace* and restores functions to
their normal, untraced state.  3untrace* accepts multiple specifications,
e.g. 3(untrace foo quux fuphoo)*.  Calling 3untrace* with no arguments
will untrace all functions currently being traced.
.end_defspec

.defvar trace-compile-flag
If the value of 3trace-compile-flag* is non-3nil*, the functions
created by 3trace* are compiled, allowing you to trace special
forms such as 3cond* without interfering with the execution of the
tracing functions.  The default value of this flag is 3nil*.

See also the function 3compile-encapsulations*, (compile-encapsulations-fun).
.end_defvar

.section Breakon

The function 3breakon* allows you to request that the debugger be
entered whenever a certain function is called.

.defun breakon function-spec &optional condition-form
Encapsulates the definition of 2function-spec* so that a trap-on-call
occurs when it is called.  This enters the debugger.  A
trap-on-exit will occur when the stack frame is exited.

If 2condition-form* is non-3nil*, its value should be a form to be
evaluated each time 2function-spec* is called. The trap occurs only if
2condition-form* evaluates to non-3nil*.  Omitting the
2condition-form* is equivalent to supplying 3t*.  If 3breakon* is
called more than once for the same 2function-spec* and different
2condition-form*s, the trap occurs if any of the conditions are true.

3breakon* with no arguments returns a list of the functions that
are broken on.
.end_defun

Conditional breakons are useful for causing the trap to occur only in a
certain stack group.  This sometimes allows debugging of functions
that are being used frequently in background processes.
.lisp
(breakon 'foo `(eq current-stack-group ',current-stack-group))
.end_lisp

If you wish to trap on calls to 3foo* when called from the execution of
3bar*, you can use 3(si:function-active-p 'bar)* as the condition.
If you want to trap only calls made directly from 3bar*, the thing to
do is
.lisp
(breakon '(:within bar foo))
.end_lisp
rather than a conditional breakon.

To break only the 2n*'th time 3foo* is called, do
.lisp
(defvar i 2n*)
(breakon 'foo '(zerop (decf i)))
.end_lisp

Another useful form of conditional breakon allows you to control
trapping from the keyboard:
.lisp
(breakon 'foo '(tv:key-state :mode-lock))
.end_lisp
The trap occurs only when the 3Mode-Lock* key is down.  This key
is not normally used for much else.  With this technique, you can
successfully trap on functions used by the debugger!

.defun unbreakon function-spec &optional conditional-form
Remove the 3breakon* set on 2function-spec*.  If
2conditional-form* is specified, remove only that condition.  Breakons
with other conditions are not removed.

With no arguments, 3unbreakon* removes all breakons from all
functions.
.end_defun

To cause the encapsulation which implements the breakon to be compiled,
call 3compile-encapsulations* or set 3compile-encapsulations-flag*
non-3nil*.  See (compile-encapsulations-fun).  This may eliminate
some of the problems that occur if you breakon a function such as
3prog* that is used by the evaluator.  (A conditional to trap only in
one stack group will help here also.)

.section Advising a Function
.setq advise section-page
.cindex advice to functions

To advise a function is to tell it to do something extra in addition to its
actual definition.  It is done by means of the function 3advise*.  The
something extra is called a piece of advice, and it can be done before, after,
or around the definition itself.  The advice and the definition are independent,
in that changing either one does not interfere with the other.  Each function
can be given any number of pieces of advice.

Advising is fairly similar to tracing, but its purpose is different.  Tracing is
intended for temporary changes to a function to give the user information about
when and how the function is called and when and with what value it returns.
Advising is intended for semi-permanent changes to what a function actually
does.  The differences between tracing and advising are motivated by this
difference in goals.

Advice can be used for testing out a change to a function in a way
that is easy to retract.  In this case, you would call 3advise* from
the terminal.  It can also be used for customizing a
function that is part of a program written by someone else.  In this
case you would be likely to put a call to 3advise* in one of your
source files or your login init file (see (login-fun)), rather than modifying the other
person's source code.

Advising is implemented with encapsulation (see (encapsulate)), so if the
function is redefined (e.g. with 3defun* or by loading it from a QFASL file)
the advice will be transferred from the old definition to the new definition.

.defmac advise
A function is advised by the special form
.lisp
(advise 2function* 2class* 2name* 2position*
  2form1* 2form2*...)
.end_lisp
None of this is evaluated.  2function* is the function to put the advice on.
It is usually a symbol, but any function spec is allowed (see (function-spec)).
The 2forms* are the advice; they get evaluated when the function is called.
2class* should be either 3:before*, 3:after*, or 3:around*, and says
when to execute the advice (before, after, or around the execution of the
definition of the function).  The meaning of 3:around* advice is explained a
couple of sections below.

2name* is used to keep track of multiple pieces of advice on the same
function.  2name* is an arbitrary symbol that is remembered as the
name of this particular piece of advice.  If you have no name in mind,
use 3nil*; then we say the piece of advice is anonymous.  A given
function and class can have any number of pieces of anonymous advice,
but it can have only one piece of named advice for any one name.  If
you try to define a second one, it replaces the first.  Advice for
testing purposes is usually anonymous.  Advice used for customizing
someone else's program should usually be named so that multiple
customizations to one function have separate names.  Then, if you
reload a customization that is already loaded, it does not get put on
twice.

2position* says where to put this piece of advice in relation to
others of the same class already present on the same function.  If
2position* is 2nil*, the new advice goes in the default position: it
usually goes at the beginning (where it is executed before the other
advice), but if it is replacing another piece of advice with the same
name, it goes in the same place that the old piece of advice was in.

If you wish to specify the position, 2position* can be the numerical index of
which existing piece of advice to insert this one before.  Zero means
at the beginning; a very large number means at the end.  Or,
2position* can be the name of an existing piece of advice of the same
class on the same function; the new advice is inserted before that
one.

.lisp
.exdent 96 1For example,*
(advise factorial :before negative-arg-check nil
  (if (minusp (first arglist))
      (ferror nil "factorial of negative argument")))
.end_lisp
This modifies the (hypothetical) factorial function so that if it is
called with a negative argument it signals an error instead of running
forever.

3advise* with no arguments returns a list of advised functions.
.end_defmac

.defmac unadvise
.lisp
(unadvise 2function* 2class* 2position*)
.end_lisp
removes pieces of advice.  None of its arguments are evaluated.  2function*
and 2class* have the same meaning as they do in the function 3advise*.
2position* specifies which piece of advice to remove.  It can be the numeric
index (zero means the first one) or it can be the name of the piece of advice.

If some of the arguments
are missing or 3nil*, all pieces of advice which match the non-3nil* arguments
are removed.  Thus, if 2function* is missing or 3nil*, all advice on all
functions which match the specified 2class* and 2position* are removed.
If 2position* is missing or 3nil*, then all advice of the specified class
on the specified function is removed.  If only 2function* is non-3nil*,
all advice on that function is removed.
.end_defmac

The following are the primitive functions for adding and removing advice.
Unlike the above special forms, these are functions and can be conveniently
used by programs.  3advise* and 3unadvise* are actually macros that
expand into calls to these two.

.defun si:advise-1 function class name position forms
Adds advice.  The arguments have the same meaning as in 3advise*.
Note that the 2forms* argument is 2not* a 3&rest* argument.
.end_defun

.defun si:unadvise-1  &optional function class position
Removes advice.  If 2function* or 2class* or 2position* is 3nil*
or unspecified, advice is removed from all functions or all classes of
advice or advice at all positions are removed.
.end_defun

You can find out manually what advice a function has with 3grindef*, which
grinds the advice on the function as forms that are calls to
3advise*.  These are in addition to the definition of the function.

To cause the advice to be compiled, call 3compile-encapsulations* or
set 3compile-encapsulations-flag* non-3nil*.  See
(compile-encapsulations-fun).

.subsection Designing the Advice

For advice to interact usefully with the definition and intended
purpose of the function, it must be able to interface to the data flow
and control flow through the function.  We provide conventions for
doing this.

The list of the arguments to the function can be found in the variable
3arglist*.  3:before* advice can replace this list, or an element of it, to
change the arguments passed to the definition itself.  If you replace
an element, it is wise to copy the whole list first with
.lisp
(setq arglist (copylist arglist))
.end_lisp
After the function's definition has been executed, the list of the
values it returned can be found in the variable 3values*.  3:after* advice
can set this variable or replace its elements to cause different
values to be returned.

All the advice is executed within a 3block nil* so any piece of advice can
exit the entire function with 3return*.  The arguments of the 3return*
are returned as the values of the function and no further advice
is executed.  If a piece of 3:before* advice does this then the
function's definition is not even called.

.subsection :around Advice

A piece of 3:before* or 3:after* advice is executed entirely before or
entirely after the definition of the function.  3:around* advice is wrapped
around the definition; that is, the call to the original definition of
the function is done at a specified place inside the piece of 3:around*
advice.  You specify where by putting the symbol 3:do-it* in that place.

For example, 3(+ 5 :do-it)* as a piece of 3:around* advice would add 35* to
the value returned by the function.  This could also be done by
3(setq values (list (+ 5 (car values))))* as 3:after* advice.

When there is more than one piece of 3:around* advice, the pieces are stored
in a sequence just like 3:before* and 3:after* advice.  Then, the first
piece of advice in the sequence is the one started first.  The second
piece is substituted for 3:do-it* in the first one.  The third one is
substituted for 3:do-it* in the second one.  The original definition is
substituted for 3:do-it* in the last piece of advice.

3:around* advice can access 3arglist*, but 3values* is not set up until the
outermost 3:around* advice returns.  At that time, it is set to the
value returned by the 3:around* advice.  It is reasonable for the advice to
receive the values of the 3:do-it* (e.g. with 3multiple-value-list*) and
fool with them before returning them (e.g. with 3values-list*).

3:around* advice can 3return* from the 3block* at any time, whether the
original definition has been executed yet or not.  It can also override
the original definition by failing to contain 3:do-it*.  Containing two
instances of 3:do-it* may be useful under peculiar circumstances.  If you
are careless, the original definition may be called twice, but
something like
.lisp
(if (foo) (+ 5 :do-it) (* 2 :do-it))
.end_lisp
will work reasonably.

.subsection Advising One Function Within Another

It is possible to advise the function 3foo* only for when it is called
directly from a specific other function 3bar*.  You do this by
advising the function specifier 3(:within bar foo)*.  That works by
finding all occurrences of 3foo* in the definition of 3bar* and
replacing them with 3#:altered-foo-within-bar*.  (Note that this is an
uninterned symbol.)  This can be done even if 3bar*'s definition is
compiled code.  The symbol 3#:altered-foo-within-bar* starts off with
the symbol 3foo* as its definition; then the symbol
3#:altered-foo-within-bar*, rather than 3foo* itself, is advised.
The system remembers that 3foo* has been replaced inside 3bar*, so
that if you change the definition of 3bar*, or advise it, then the
replacement is propagated to the new definition or to the advice.  If
you remove all the advice on 3(:within bar foo)*, so that its
definition becomes the symbol 3foo* again, then the replacement is
unmade and everything returns to its original state.

3(grindef bar)* prints 3foo* where it originally appeared, rather than
3#:altered-foo-within-bar*, so the replacement is not seen.  Instead,
3grindef* prints calls to 3advise* to describe all the advice that
has been put on 3foo* or anything else within 3bar*.

An alternate way of putting on this sort of advice is to use
3advise-within*.

.defmac advise-within
.lisp
(advise-within 2within-function* 2function-to-advise*
	       2class* 2name* 2position*
	2forms...*)
.end_lisp
advises 2function-to-advise* only when called directly from the function
2within-function*.  The other arguments mean the same thing as with
3advise*.  None of them are evaluated.
.end_defmac

To remove advice from 3(:within bar foo)*, you can use 3unadvise* on that
function specifier.  Alternatively, you can use 3unadvise-within*.

.defmac unadvise-within
.lisp
(unadvise-within 2within-function* 2function-to-advise* 2class* 2position*)
.end_lisp
removes advice
that has been placed on 3(:within 2within-function* 2function-to-advise*)*.
Any of the four arguments may be missing or 3nil*; then that argument is
unconstrained.  All advice matching whichever arguments are non-3nil* is
removed.  For example, 3(unadvise-within foo nil :before)* removes
all 3:before*-advice from anything within 3foo*.  3(unadvise-within)*
removes all advice placed on anything within anything.  By contrast, 3(unadvise)*
removes all advice, including advice placed on a function for all callers.
Advice placed
on a function not within another specific function is never removed by
3unadvise-within*.
.end_defmac

The function versions of 3advise-within* and 3unadvise-within* are
called 3si:advise-within-1* and 3si:unadvise-within-1*.  3advise-within* and
3unadvise-within* are macros that expand into calls to the other two.


.section Stepping Through an Evaluation
.setq stepper-section section-page
.cindex stepping through evaluation

	The Step facility gives you the ability to follow every step of
the evaluation of a form, and examine what is going on.  It is
analogous to a single-step proceed facility often found in
machine-language debuggers.  If your program is doing something
strange, and it isn't obvious how it's getting into its strange state,
then the stepper is for you.

	There are two ways to enter the stepper.  One is by use of the
3step* function.

.defun step form
	This evaluates 2form* with single stepping.  It returns
the value of 2form*.
.end_defun

	For example, if you have a function named 3foo*, and typical arguments
to it might be 3t* and 33*, you could say
.lisp
(step '(foo t 3))
.end_lisp
to evaluate the form 3(foo t 3)* with single stepping.

	The other way to get into the stepper is to use the 3:step* option 
of 3trace* (see (trace-fun)).  If a function is traced with the 3:step* option, then
whenever that function is called it will be single stepped.

	Note that any function to be stepped must be interpreted; that is, it
must be a lambda-expression.  Compiled code cannot be stepped by the stepper.

	When evaluation is proceeding with single stepping, before any
form is evaluated, it is (partially) printed out, preceded by a forward
arrow (7*) character When a macro is expanded, the expansion is
printed out preceded by a double arrow (7*) character.  When a form
returns a value, the form and the values are printed out preceded by a
backwards arrow (7*) character; if there is more than one value
being returned, an and-sign (7*) character is printed between the
values.  When the stepper has evaluated the args to a form and is about
to apply the function, it prints a lambda (7*) because entering the
lambda is the next thing to be done.

	Since the forms may be very long, the stepper does not print all
of a form; it truncates the printed representation after a certain number
of characters.  Also, to show the recursion pattern of who calls whom in
a graphic fashion, it indents each form proportionally to its level
of recursion.

	After the stepper prints any of these things, it waits for a
command from the user.  There are several commands to tell the stepper
how to proceed, or to look at what is happening. The commands are:
.table 1 0 500
.item 3Control-N* (Next)
Steps to the Next event, then asks for another command.
Events include beginning to evaluate a form at any level
or finishing the evaluation of a form at any level.

.item 3Space*
.br
Steps to the next event at this level.  In other words, continue to
evaluate at this level, but don't step anything at lower levels.  This is a good
way to skip over parts of the evaluation that don't interest you.

.item 3Control-A* (Args)
Skips over the evaluation of the arguments of this form, but pauses in the stepper
before calling the function that is the car of the form.

.item 3Control-U* (Up)
Continues evaluating until we go up one level.  This is like
the space command, only more so; it skips over anything on the current level
as well as lower levels.

.item 3Control-X* (eXit)
Exits; finishes evaluation without any more stepping.

.item 3Control-T* (Type)
Retypes the current form in full (without truncation).

.item 3Control-G* (Grind)
Grinds (i.e. prettyprints) the current form.

.item 3Control-E* (Editor)
Switches windows, to the editor.

.item 3Control-B* (Breakpoint)
Enters a 3break* loop from which you can examine the values of
variables and other aspects of the current environment.  From
within this loop, the following variables are available:
.table 3
.item step-form
the current form.
.item step-values
the list of returned values.
.item step-value
the first returned value.
.end_table
If you change the values of these variables, you will affect execution.

.item 3Control-L*
Clears the screen and redisplays the last 10. pending forms (forms
that are being evaluated).

.item 3Meta-L*
Like Control-L, but doesn't clear the screen.

.item 3Control-Meta-L*
Like Control-L, but redisplays all pending forms.

.item 3?* or 3Help*
Prints documentation on these commands.
.end_table
	It is strongly suggested that you write some little function
and try the stepper on it.  If you get a feel for what the stepper does
and how it works, you will be able to tell when it is the right thing to use
to find bugs.

.section "Evalhook"

.setq evalhook-section section-page

The 3evalhook* facility provides a ``hook'' into the evaluator; it is a
way you can get a Lisp form of your choice to be executed whenever the
evaluator is called.  The stepper uses 3evalhook*, and usually it is
the only thing that ever needs to.  However, if you want to write your
own stepper or something similar, this is the primitive facility that
you can use to do so.  The way this works is a bit hairy, but unless
you need to write your own stepper you don't have to worry about it.

.defvar evalhook
.defvar1 *evalhook*
If the value of 3evalhook* is non-3nil*, then special things happen
in the evaluator.  Its value is called the 2hook function*.  When a
form (any form, even a number or a symbol) is to be evaluated, the hook
function is called instead.  Whatever values the hook function returns
are taken to be the results of the evaluation.  Both 3evalhook* and
3applyhook* are bound to 3nil* before the hook function is actually
called.

The hook function receives two arguments: the form that was to be
evaluated, and the lexical environment of evaluation.  These two
arguments allow the hook function to perform later, if it wishes,
the very same evaluation that the hook was called instead of.
.end_defvar

.defvar applyhook
.defvar1 *applyhook*
If the value of 3applyhook* is non-3nil*, it is called the
next time the interpreter is about to apply a function to its
evaluated arguments.  Whatever values the apply hook function
returns are taken to be the results of calling the other function.
Both 3evalhook* and 3applyhook* are bound to 3nil* before the
hook function is actually called.

The hook function receives three arguments: the function that was
going to be called, the list of arguments it was going to receive,
and the lexical environment of evaluation.  These
arguments allow the hook function to perform later, if it wishes,
the very same evaluation that the hook was called instead of.
.end_defvar

When either the evalhook or the applyhook is called, both variables are
bound to 3nil*.  They are also rebound to 3nil* by 3break* and by
the debugger, and 3setq*'ed to 3nil* when errors are dismissed
by throwing to the Lisp top level loop.  This provides the ability to
escape from this mode if something bad happens.

In order not to impair the efficiency of the Lisp interpreter,
several restrictions are imposed on the evalhook and applyhook.
They apply only to evaluation--whether in a read-eval-print loop,
internally in evaluating arguments in forms, or by explicit use
of the function 3eval*.  They 2do not* have any effect
on compiled function references, on use of the function 3apply*,
or on the mapping functions.

.defun evalhook form evalhook applyhook &optional environment
Evaluates 2form* in the specified 2environment*, with 2evalhook* and 2applyhook* in
effect for all recursive evaluations of subforms of 2form*.  However, the
2evalhook* is not called for the evaluation of 2form* itself.

2environment* is a list which represents the lexical environment
to be in effect for the evaluation of 2form*.  3nil* means an
empty lexical environment, in which no lexical bindings exist.  This
is the environment used when 3eval* itself is called.  Aside from
3nil*, the only reasonable way to get a value to pass for
2environment* is to use the last argument passed to a hook
function.  You must take care not to use it after the context in
which it was made is exited, because environments normally contain
stack lists which become garbage after their stack frames are
popped.

2environment* has no effect on the evaluation of a variable which
is regarded as special.  This is always done by examining the value
cell.  However, environment contains the record of the local special
declarations currently in effect, so it does enter in the decision
of whether a variable is special.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Here is an example of the use of 3evalhook*:
1;; This function evaluates a form while printing debugging information.*
(defun hook (x)
   (terpri)
   (evalhook x 'hook-function nil))

1;; Notice how this function calls 3evalhook* to evaluate the form 3f*,*
1;; so as to hook the sub-forms.*
(defun hook-function (f env)
   (let ((v (multiple-value-list
	      (evalhook f 'hook-function nil env))))
     (format t "form: ~S~%values: ~S~%" f v)
     (values-list v)))
.end_lisp

The following output might be seen from 3(hook '(cons (car '(a . b)) 'c))*:
.lisp
form: (quote (a . b))
values: ((a . b))
form: (car (quote (a . b)))
values: (a)
form: (quote c)
values: (c)
(a . c)
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun applyhook function list-of-args evalhook applyhook &optional environment
Applies 2function* to 2list-of-args* in the specified 2environment*, with 2evalhook*
and 2applyhook* in effect for all recursive evaluations of subforms of 2function*'s body.
However, 2applyhook* is not called for this application of function itself.
For more information, refer to the definition of 3evalhook*, immediately above.
.end_defun

.section "The MAR"
.cindex MAR
.setq mar section-page

	The MAR facility allows any word or contiguous set of words to
be monitored constantly, and can cause an error if the words are
referenced in a specified manner.  The name MAR is from the similar
device on the ITS PDP-10's; it is an acronym for `Memory Address
Register'.  The MAR checking is done by the Lisp Machine's memory
management hardware, so the speed of general execution is not
significantly slowed down when the MAR is enabled.  However, the speed
of accessing pages of memory containing the locations being checked is
slowed down somewhat, since every reference involves a microcode trap.

	These are the functions that control the MAR:

.defun set-mar location cycle-type &optional n-words
Sets the MAR on 2n-words* words, starting at 2location*.
2location* may be any object.  Often it will be a locative pointer
to a cell, probably created with the 3locf* special form.
2n-words* currently defaults to 1,
but eventually it may default to the size of the object.
2cycle-type* says under what conditions to trap.  3:read* means that
only reading the location should cause an error, 3:write* means that
only writing the location should, 3t* means that both should.
To set the MAR to detect 3setq* (and binding) of the variable 3foo*, use
.lisp
(set-mar (variable-location foo) :write)
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun clear-mar
Turns off the MAR.  Warm-booting the machine disables the
MAR but does not turn it off, i.e. references to the MARed pages
are still slowed down.  3clear-mar* does not currently speed
things back up until the next time the pages are swapped out;
this may be fixed some day.
.end_defun

.defun mar-mode
3(mar-mode)* returns a symbol indicating the current state of
the MAR.  It returns one of:
.table 3
.item nil
The MAR is not set.
.item :read
The MAR will cause an error if there is a read.
.item :write
The MAR will cause an error if there is a write.
.item t
The MAR will cause an error if there is any reference.
.end_table
.end_defun

Note that using the MAR makes the pages on which it is set
somewhat slower to access, until the next time they are
swapped out and back in again after the MAR is shut off.
Also, use of the MAR currently breaks the read-only feature
if those pages were read-only.

Proceeding from a MAR break allows the memory reference that got an error
to take place, and continues the program with the MAR still effective.  When
proceeding from a write, you have the choice of whether to allow the
write to take place or to inhibit it, leaving the location with its old
contents.

.defcondition sys:mar-break (3condition*)
This is the condition, not an error, signaled by a MAR break.

The condition instance supports these operations:
.table 3
.item :object
The object one of whose words was being referenced.

.item :offset
The offset within the object of the word being referenced.

.item :value
The value read, or to be written.

.item :direction
Either 3:read* or 3:write*.
.end_table

The proceed type 3:no-action* simply proceeds, continuing with the
interrupted program as if the MAR had not been set.  If the trap was due
to writing, the proceed type 3:proceed-no-write* is also provided, and
causes the program to proceed but does not store the value in the memory
location.
.end_defcondition

Most--but not all--write operations first do a read.  3setq* and
3rplaca* both do.  This means that if the MAR is in 3:read*
mode it catches writes as well as reads; however, they trap
during the reading phase, and consequently the data to be written are
not yet known.  This also means that setting the MAR to 3t* mode
causes most writes to trap twice, first for a read and then again for a
write.  So when the MAR says that it trapped because of a read, this
means a read at the hardware level, which may not look like a read in
your program.
