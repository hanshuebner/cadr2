.chapter Characters and Strings
.setq string-chapter chapter-number
.cindex string

	A string is a one-dimensional array representing a sequence of
characters.  The printed representation of a string is its characters
enclosed in quotation marks, for example 3"foo bar"*.  Strings are
constants, that is, evaluating a string returns that string.  Strings
are the right data type to use for text-processing.

.cindex character object
Individual characters can be represented by 2character objects* or by
fixnums.  A character object is actually the same as a fixnum except
that it has a recognizably different data type and prints differently.
Without escaping, a character object is printed by outputting the
character it represents.  With escaping, a character object prints as
3#\2char** in Common Lisp syntax or as 3#/2char** in
traditional syntax; see (character-set) and (sharp-slash).  By
contrast, a fixnum would in all cases print as a sequence of digits.
Character objects are accepted by most numeric functions in place of
fixnums, and may be used as array indices.  When evaluated, they are
constants.

The character object data type was introduced recently for Common Lisp
support.  Traditionally characters were always represented as fixnums,
and nearly all system and user code still does so.  Character objects
are interchangeable with fixnums in most contexts, but not in 3eq*,
which is often used to compare the result of the stream input operations
such as 3:tyi*, since that might be 3nil*.  Therefore, the
stream input operations still return fixnums that represent characters.
Aside from this, Common Lisp functions that return a character return a
character object, while traditional functions return a fixnum.  The
fixnum which is the character code representing 2char* can be written
as 3#/2char** in traditional syntax.  This is equivalent to writing
the fixnum using digits, but does not require you to know the character
code.

Most strings are arrays of type 3art-string*, where each element is
stored in eight bits.  Only characters with character code less than 256
can be stored in an ordinary string; these characters form the type
3string-char*.  A string can also be an array of type
3art-fat-string*, where each element holds a sixteen-bit unsigned
fixnum.  The extra bits allow for multiple fonts or an expanded character
set.

	Since strings are arrays, the usual array-referencing function
3aref* is used to extract characters from strings.  For example,
3(aref "frob" 1)* returns the representation of lower case 3r*.
The first character is at index zero.

.setq string-element-type page
Conceptually, the elements of a string are character objects.
This is what Common Lisp programs expect to see when they do
3aref* (or 3char*, which on the Lisp
Machine is synonymous with 3aref*) on a string.  But nearly all
Lisp Machine programs are traditional, and expect elements of strings
to be fixnums.  Therefore, 3aref* of a string actually returns
a fixnum.  A distinct version of 3aref* exists for Common Lisp
programs.  It is 3cli:aref* and it does return character objects
if given a string.  For all other kinds of arrays, 3aref* and 3cli:aref*
are equivalent.
.lisp
(aref "Foo" 1)  =>  #o157
(cli:aref "Foo" 1)  =>  #/o
.end_lisp

It is also legal to store into strings, for example using 3setf* of
3aref*.  As with 3rplaca* on lists, this changes the actual object;
you must be careful to understand where side-effects will propagate.  It
makes no difference whether a character object or a fixnum is stored.
When you are making strings that you intend to change later, you
probably want to create an array with a fill-pointer (see
(fill-pointer)) so that you can change the length of the string as well
as the contents.  The length of a string is always computed using
3array-active-length*, so that if a string has a fill-pointer, its
value is used as the length.

The functions described in this section provide a variety of useful
operations on strings.  In place of a string, most of these functions
accept a symbol or a fixnum as an argument, coercing it into a
string.  Given a symbol, its print name, which is a string, is used.
Given a fixnum, a one-character string containing the character designated
by that fixnum is used.  Several of the functions actually work on any
type of one-dimensional array and may be useful for other than string
processing; these are the functions such as 3substring* and 3string-length*
which do not depend on the elements of the string being characters.

The generic sequence functions in chapter (sequence-chapter) may
also be used on strings.

.section Characters
.setq characters section-page
.cindex characters

The Lisp Machine data type for character objects is a recent addition
to the system.  Most programs still use fixnums to represent characters.

Common Lisp programs typically work with actual character objects but
programs traditionally use fixnums to represent characters.  The new
Common Lisp functions for operating with characters have been implemented
to accept fixnums as well, so that they can be used equally well from
traditional programs.

.defun characterp object
3t* if 2object* is a character object; 3nil* otherwise.
In particular, it is 3nil* if 2object* is a fixnum such as
traditional programs use to represent characters.
.end_defun

.defun character object
Coerces 3object* to a single character,
represented as a fixnum.  If 3object* is a number, it is returned.  If
3object* is a string or an array, its first element is returned.  If
3object* is a symbol, the first character of its pname is returned.
Otherwise an error occurs.  The way characters are represented as fixnums
is explained in (character-set).
.end_defun

.defun cli:character object
Coerces 2object* into a character and returns the character as a character object
for Common Lisp programs.
.end_defun

.defun int-char fixnum
Converts 2fixnum*, regarded as representing a character, to a
character object.  This is a special case of 3cli:character*.
3(int-char #o101)* is the character object for 3A*.  If a character
object is given as an argument, it is returned unchanged.
.end_defun

.defun char-int char
Converts 2char*, a character object, to the fixnum which represents
the same character.  This is the inverse of 3int-char*.  It may also
be given a fixnum as argument, in which case the value is the same
fixnum.
.end_defun

.subsection Components of a Character
.cindex character code
.cindex font (of a character)
.cindex bits (of a character)
.cindex modifier bits (of a character)
.cindex character set
.setq character-set section-page

A character object, or a fixnum which is interpreted as a character,
contains three separate pieces of information: the 2character code*,
the 2font number*, and the 2modifier bits*.  Each of these things
is an integer from a fixed range.  The character code ranges from 0 to
377 (octal), the font number from 0 to 377 (octal), and the modifier
bits from 0 to 17 (octal).  These numeric constants should not appear
in programs; instead, use the constant symbols 3char-code-limit*,
and so on, described below.

Ordinary strings can hold only characters whose font number and modifier
bits are zero.  Fat strings can hold characters with any font number,
but the modifier bits must still be zero.

Character codes less than 200 octal are printing graphics;
when output to a device they are assumed to print a character and move
the cursor one character position to the right.  (All software provides
for variable-width fonts, so the term ``character position'' shouldn't
be taken too literally.)

Character codes 200 through 236 octal are used for special characters.
Character 200 is a ``null character'', which does not correspond to any
key on the keyboard.  The null character is not used for anything much;
3fasload* uses it internally.  Characters 201 through 236 correspond
to the special function keys on the keyboard such as 3Return* and
3Call*.  The remaining character codes 237 through 377 octal are reserved
for future expansion.

	Most of the special characters do not normally appear in files
(although it is not forbidden for files to contain them).  These
characters exist mainly to be used as ``commands'' from the keyboard.  A
few special characters, however, are ``format effectors'' which are just
as legitimate as printing characters in text files.  The names and
meanings of these characters are:

.table 3
.item Return
The ``newline'' character, which separates lines of text.  We do not use
the PDP-10 convention which separates lines by a pair of characters, a
``carriage return'' and a ``linefeed''.

.item Page
The ``page separator'' character, which separates pages of text.

.item Tab
The ``tabulation'' character, which spaces to the right until the next ``tab stop''.
Tab stops are normally every 8 character positions.
.end_table

The space character is considered to be a printing character whose printed image
happens to be blank, rather than a format effector.

	When a letter is typed with any of the modifier bit keys
(3Control*, 3Meta*, 3Super*, or 3Hyper*), the letter is normally
upper-case.  If the 3Shift* key is pressed as well, then the letter
becomes lower-case.  This is exactly the reverse of what the 3Shift*
key does to letters without control bits.  (The 3Shift-lock* key has
no effect on letters with control bits.)

.defun char-code char
.defun1 char-font char
.defun1 char-bits char
Return the character code of 2char*, the font number of 2char*,
and the modifier bits value of 2char*.  2char* may
be a fixnum or a character object; the value is always a fixnum.

These used to be written as
.lisp
(ldb %%ch-char 2char*)
(ldb %%ch-font 2char*)
(ldb %%ch-control-meta 2char*)
.end_lisp
Such use of 3ldb* is frequent but obsolete.
.end_defun

.defconst char-code-limit
A constant whose value is a bound on the maximum code of any character.
In the Lisp Machine, currently, it is 400 (octal).
.end_defconst

.defconst char-font-limit
A constant whose value is a bound on the maximum font number value of
any character.  In the Lisp Machine, currently, it is 400 (octal).
.end_defconst

.defconst char-bits-limit
A constant whose value is a bound on the maximum modifier bits value of
any character.  In the Lisp Machine, currently, it is 20 (octal).  Thus,
there are four modifier bits.  These are just the familiar Control, Meta,
Super and Hyper bits.
.end_defconst

.defconst char-control-bit
.defconst1 char-meta-bit
.defconst1 char-super-bit
.defconst1 char-hyper-bit
Constants with values 1, 2, 4 and 8.
These give the meanings of the bits within the bits-field of a character object.
Thus, 3(bit-test char-meta-bit (char-bits 2char*))* would be non-3nil*
if 2char* is a meta-character.  (This can also be tested with 3char-bit*.)
.end_defconst

.defun char-bit char name
3t* if 2char* has the modifier bit named by 2name*.  2name* is
one of the following four symbols: 3:control*, 3:meta*,
3:super*, and 3:hyper*.
.lisp
(char-bit #\meta-x :meta) => t.
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun set-char-bit char name newvalue
Returns a character like 2char* except that the bit specified by 2name*
is present if 2newvalue* is non-3nil*, absent otherwise.  Thus,
.lisp
(set-char-bit #\x :meta t) => #\meta-x.
.end_lisp
The value is a fixnum if 2char* is one; a character object if 2char* is one.
.end_defun

.c  	Since the control bits are not part of the fundamental 8-bit
.c character codes, there is no way to express keyboard input in terms of
.c simple character codes.  However, there is a convention accepted by the
.c relevant programs for encoding keyboard input into a string of
.c characters: if a character has its 3Control* bit on, prefix it with an
.c alpha.  If a character has its 3Meta* bit on, prefix it with a
.c beta.  If a character has both its 3Control* and 3Meta* bits on,
.c prefix it with an epsilon.  If a character has its 3Super* bit on,
.c prefix it with a pi.  If a character has its 3Hyper* bit on,
.c prefix it with a lambda.  To get an alpha, beta,
.c epsilon, pi, lambda, or equivalence into the string,
.c quote it by prefixing it with an equivalence.

.cindex keyboard character
Until recently the only way to access
the character code, font and modifier bits was with 3ldb*,
using the byte field names listed below.
Most code still uses that method, but it is obsolete; 3char-bit*
should be used instead.
.setq %%kbd page
.cindex %%kbd fields

.table 3
.item %%kbd-char
.item1 %%ch-char
'vindex %%kbd-char
'vindex %%ch-char
Specifies the byte containing the character code.

.item %%ch-font
'vindex %%ch-font
Specifies the byte containing the font number.

.item %%kbd-control
'vindex %%kbd-control
Specifies the byte containing the Control bit.

.item %%kbd-meta
'vindex %%kbd-meta
Specifies the byte containing the Meta bit.

.item %%kbd-super
'vindex %%kbd-super
Specifies the byte containing the Super bit.

.item %%kbd-hyper
'vindex %%kbd-hyper
Specifies the byte containing the Hyper bit.

.item %%kbd-control-meta
'vindex %%kbd-control-meta
Specifies the byte containing all the modifier bits.
.end_table

Characters are sometimes used to represent mouse clicks.  The character
says which button was pressed and how many times.  Refer to the Window
System manual for an explanation of how these characters are generated.

.defun tv:kbd-mouse-p char
3t* if 2char* is a character used to represent a mouse click.
Such characters are always distinguishable from characters that represent
keyboard input.
.end_defun

.defconst %%kbd-mouse-button
The value of 3%%kbd-mouse-button* is a byte specifier for the field in
a mouse signal that says which button was clicked.  The byte contains
30*, 31*, or 32* for the left, middle, or right button,
respectively.
.end_defconst

.defconst %%kbd-mouse-n-clicks
The value of 3%%kbd-mouse-n-clicks* 
is a byte specifier for the field in a mouse signal
that says how many times the button was clicked.
The byte contains one less than the number of times the button was clicked.
.end_defconst

.subsection Constructing Character Objects

.defun code-char code &optional (bits 30*) (font 30*)
.defun1 make-char code &optional (bits 30*) (font 30*)
Returns a character object made from 2code*, 2bits* and 2font*.
Common Lisp says that not all combinations may be valid, and that 3nil*
is returned for an invalid combination.  On the Lisp Machine, any combination
is valid if the arguments are valid individually.

According to Common Lisp, 3code-char* requires a number as a first
argument, whereas 3make-char* requires a character object, whose character
code is used.  On the Lisp Machine, either function may be used in either way.
.end_defun

.defun digit-char weight &optional (radix 310.*) (font 30*)
Returns a character object which is the digit with the specified weight,
and with font as specified.  However, if there is no suitable character
which has weight 2weight* in the specified radix, the value is 3nil*.
If the ``digit'' is a letter (which happens if 2weight* is greater than
9), it is returned in upper case.
.end_defun

.defun tv:make-mouse-char button n-clicks
Returns the fixnum character code that represents a mouse click in the
standard way.  3tv:mouse-char-p* of this value is 3t*.
2button* is 0 for the leftbutton, 1 for the middle button,
or 2 for the right button.  2n-clicks* is one less than the
number of clicks (1 for a double click, 0 normally).
.end_defun

.subsection The Character Set
.cindex character code values
.setq character-code-values section-page

Here are the numerical values of the characters in the Zetalisp
character set.  It should never be necessary for a user or a source
program to know these values.  Indeed, they are likely to be
changed in the future.  There are symbolic names for all characters; see
the section on character names, below.

It is worth pointing out that the Zetalisp character
set is different from the ASCII character set.   File servers
operating on hosts that use ASCII for storing text files
automatically perform character set conversion when text files
are read or written.  The details of the mapping are explained in
(character-set-differences).

.subsection Classifying Characters

.defun string-char-p char
3t* if 2char* is a character that can be stored in a string.  On the
Lisp Machine, this is true if the font and modifier bits of 2char* are zero.
.end_defun

.defun standard-char-p char
3t* if 2char* is a standard Common Lisp character: any of the 95
ASCII printing characters (including 3Space*), and the 3Return* character.
Thus 3(standard-char-p #\end)* is 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun graphic-char-p char
3t* if 2char* is a graphic character; one which has a printed shape.
3A*, 3-*, 3Space* and 7* are all graphic characters; 3Return*,
3End* and 3Abort* are not.  A character whose modifier bits are
nonzero is never graphic.

Ordinary output to windows prints graphic characters using the current font.
Nongraphic characters are printed using lozenges unless they have special
formatting meanings (as 3Return* does).
.end_defun

.defun alpha-char-p char
3t* if 2char* is a letter with zero modifier bits.
.end_defun

.defun digit-char-p char &optional (radix 310.*)
If 2char* is a digit available in the specified radix, returns the
2weight* of that digit.  Otherwise, it returns 3nil*.  If the modifier
bits of 2char* are nonzero, the value is always 3nil*.  (It would be
more useful to ignore the modifier bits, but this decision provides
Common Lisp with a foolish consistency.)  Examples:
.lisp
(digit-char-p #\8 8) => nil
(digit-char-p #\8 9) => 8
(digit-char-p #\F 16.) => 15.
(digit-char-p #\c-8 2anything*) => nil
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun alphanumericp char
3t* if 2char* is a letter or a digit 0 through 9, with zero modifier bits.
.end_defun

.subsection Comparing Characters

.defun char-equal &rest chars
This is the primitive for comparing characters for equality; many of the
string functions call it.  The arguments may be fixnums or character
objects indiscriminately.  The result is 3t* if the characters are
equal ignoring case, font and modifier bits, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun char-not-equal &rest chars
3t* if the arguments are all different as characters, ignoring
case, font and modifier bits.
.end_defun

.defun char-lessp &rest chars
.defun1 char-greaterp &rest chars
.defun1 char-not-lessp &rest chars
.defun1 char-not-greaterp &rest chars
Ordered comparison of characters, ignoring case, font and modifier bits.
These are the primitives for comparing characters for order; many of the
string functions call it.  The arguments may be fixnums or character
objects.  The result is 3t* if the arguments are in strictly increasing
(strictly decreasing, nonincreasing, nondecreasing) order.  Details of the
ordering of characters are in (character-set).
.end_defun

.defun char= char1 &rest chars
.defun1 char//= char1 &rest chars
.defun1 char> char1 &rest chars
.defun1 char< char1 &rest chars
.defun1 char>= char1 &rest chars
.defun1 char<= char1 &rest chars
These are the Common Lisp functions for comparing characters and 
including the case, font and bits in the comparison.  On the Lisp Machine
they are synonyms for the numeric comparison functions 3=*, 3>*, etc.
Note that in Common Lisp syntax you would write 3char/=*, not 3char//=*.

.subsection Character Names
.setq xr-special-character-names section-page
.cindex special character

Characters can sometimes be referred to by long names; as, for
example, in the 3#\* construct in Lisp programs.  Every basic
character (zero modifier bits) which is not a graphic character has
one or more standard names.  Some graphic characters have standard
names too.  When a non-graphic character is output to a window, it
appears as a lozenge containing the character's standard name.

.defun char-name char
Returns the standard name (or one of the standard names) of 2char*, or
3nil* if there is none.  The name is returned as a string.
3(char-name #\space)* is the string 3"SPACE"*.

If 2char* has nonzero modifier bits, the value
is 3nil*.  Compound names such as 3Control-X* are not constructed by
this function.
.end_defun

.defun name-char name
Returns (as a character object) the character for which 2name* is a name,
or returns 3nil* if 2name* is not a recognized character name.
2name* may be a symbol or a string.
Compound names such as 3Control-X* are not recognized.

3read* uses this function to process the 3#\* construct when
a character name is encountered.
.end_defun

The following are the recognized special character names, in alphabetical order except
with synonyms together.  Character names are encoded and decoded by the functions
3char-name* and 3name-char* ((char-name-fun)).

First a list of the special function keys.

.section Conversion to Upper or Lower Case
.cindex case conversion
.cindex alphabetic case
.cindex upper case letter
.cindex lower case letter

.defun upper-case-p char
3t* if 2char* is an upper case letter with zero modifier bits.
.end_defun

.defun lower-case-p char
3t* if 2char* is an lower case letter with zero modifier bits.
.end_defun

.defun both-case-p char
This Common Lisp function is defined to return
3t* if 2char* is a character which has distinct upper and lower case forms.
On the Lisp Machine it returns 3t* if 2char* is a letter with zero
modifier bits.
.end_defun

.defun char-upcase char
	If 2char*, is a lower-case alphabetic
character its upper-case form is returned; otherwise, 2char* itself is
returned.  If font information or modifier bits are present, they are preserved.
If 2char* is a fixnum, the value is a fixnum.  If 2char* is a character
object, the value is a character object.
.end_defun

.defun char-downcase char
Similar, but converts to lower case.
.end_defun

.defun string-upcase string &key (start 30*) end
Returns a string like 2string*, with all lower-case alphabetic
characters replaced by the corresponding upper-case characters.
If 2start* or 2end* is specified, only the specified portion
of the string is converted, but in any case the entire string is
returned.

The result is a copy of 2string* unless no change is necessary.
2string* itself is never modified.
.end_defun

.defun string-downcase string &key (start 30*) end
Similar, but converts to lower case.
.end_defun

.defun string-capitalize string &key (start 30*) end
Returns a string like 2string* in which all, or the specified portion, has been
processed by capitalizing each word.  For this function, a word is any maximal
sequence of letters or digits.  It is capitalized by putting the first character
(if it is a letter) in upper case and any letters in the rest of the word in lower case.

The result is a copy of 2string* unless no change is necessary.
2string* itself is never modified.
.end_defun

.defun nstring-upcase string &key (start 30*) end
.defun1 nstring-downcase string &key (start 30*) end
.defun1 nstring-capitalize string &key (start 30*) end
Like the previous functions except that they modify 2string* itself and return it.
.end_defun

.defun string-capitalize-words string &optional (copy-p 3t*) (spaces 3t*)
Puts each word in 2string* into lower-case with an upper case initial,
and if 2spaces* is non-3nil* replaces each hyphen character with a space.

If 2copy-p* is 3t*, the value is a copy of 2string*, and
2string* itself is unchanged.  Otherwise, 2string* itself is
returned, with its contents changed.

This function is somewhat obsolete.  One can use 3string-capitalize*
followed optionally by 3string-subst-char*.
.end_defun

See also the 3format* operation 3~(*...3~)* on (format-case-convert).

.section Basic String Operations

.defun make-string size &key (initial-element 30*)
Creates and returns a string of length 2size*, with each element
initialized to 2initial-element*, which may be a fixnum
or a character.
.end_defun

.defun string x
Coerces 2x* into a string.  Most of the string functions apply this to
their string arguments.  If 2x* is a string (or any array), it is
returned.  If 2x* is a symbol, its pname is returned.  If 2x* is a
non-negative fixnum less than 400 octal, a one-character-long string
containing it is created and returned.  If 2x* is an instance that
supports the 3:string-for-printing* operation (such as, a pathname)
then the result of that operation is returned.  Otherwise, an error is
signaled.

If you want to get the printed representation of an object into the
form of a string, this function is 2not* what you should use.
You can use 3format*, passing a first argument of 3nil* (see (format-fun)).
You might also want to use 3with-output-to-string* (see
(with-output-to-string-fun)).
.end_defun

.defun string-length string
Returns the number of characters in 2string*.  This is 1
if 2string* is a number or character object, the 3array-active-length*
(see (array-active-length-fun))
if 2string*
is an array, or the 3array-active-length* of the pname if 2string* is a symbol.
.end_defun

.defun string-equal string1 string2 &key (start1 30*) (start2 30*) end1 end2
Compares two strings, returning 3t* if
they are equal and 3nil* if they are not.  The comparison ignores
the font and case of the characters.  3equal* calls 3string-equal* if
applied to two strings.
	The keyword arguments 2start1* and 2start2* are the starting
indices into the strings.  2end1* and 2end2*
are the final indices; the comparison stops just 2before* the final index.
3nil* for 2end1* or 2end2* means stop at the end of the string.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(string-equal "Foo" "foo") => t
(string-equal "foo" "bar") => nil
(string-equal "element" "select" 0 1 3 4) => t
.end_lisp

An older calling sequence in which the 2start* and 2end* arguments are
positional rather than keyword is still supported.  The arguments
come in the order 2start1* 2start2* 2end1* 2end2*.  This calling
sequence is obsolete and should be changed whenever found.

3(not (string-equal ...))*
.end_defun

.defun string= string1 string2 &key (start1 30*) (start2 30*) end1 end2
is like 3string-equal* except that case is significant.

.defun1 string//= string1 string2 &key (start1 30*) end1 (start2 30*) end2
3(not (string= ...))*.  Note that in Common Lisp syntax you would

.end_defun

.defun string-lessp string1 string2 &key (start1 30*) end1 (start2 30*) end2
.defun1 string-greaterp string1 string2 &key (start1 30*) end1 (start2 30*) end2
.defun1 string-not-greaterp string1 string2 &key (start1 30*) end1 (start2 30*) end2
.defun1 string-not-lessp string1 string2 &key (start1 30*) end1 (start2 30*) end2
Compare all or the specified portions of 2string1* and 2string2*
using dictionary order.  Characters are compared using 3char-lessp*
and 3char-equal* so that font and alphabetic case are ignored.

You can use these functions as predicates, but they do more.
If the strings fit the condition (e.g. 2string1* is strictly less in
3string-lessp*) then the value is a number, the index in 2string1*
of the first point of difference between the strings.  This equals
the length of 2string1* if the strings match.  If the condition is
not met, the value is 3nil*.
.lisp
(string-lessp "aa" "Ab") => 1
(string-lessp "aa" "Ab" :end1 1 :end2 1) => nil
(string-not-greaterp "Aa" "Ab" :end1 1 :end2 1) => 1

.defun1 string string1 string2 &key (start1 30*) end1 (start2 30*) end2
Like 3string-lessp*, etc., but treat case and font as significant
when comparing characters.
.lisp
(string< "AA" "aa") => 0
(string-lessp "AA" "aa") => nil
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-compare string1 string2 &optional (start1 30*) (start2 30*) end1 end2
Compares two strings using dictionary order (as defined
by 3char-lessp*).  The arguments are interpreted as in 3string-equal*.
The result is 30* if the strings are equal, a negative number if 2string1*
is less than 2string2*, or a positive number if 2string1* is greater than
2string2*.  If the strings are not equal, the absolute value of the
number returned is one greater than the index (in 2string1*) where the first
difference occurred.
.end_defun

.defun substring string start &optional end area
Extracts a substring of 2string*, starting at the
character specified by 2start* and going up to but not including
the character specified by 2end*.  2start* and 2end* are
0-origin indices.  The length of the returned string is 2end* minus
2start*.  If 2end* is not specified it defaults to the length
of 2string*.  The area in which the result is to be consed may be
optionally specified.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(substring "Nebuchadnezzar" 4 8) => "chad"
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun nsubstring string start &optional end area
Is like 3substring* except that the substring
is not copied; instead an indirect array (see (indirect-array)) is created which shares part
of the argument 2string*.  Modifying one string will modify the other.

Note that 3nsubstring* does not necessarily use less storage than
3substring*; an 3nsubstring* of any length uses at least as much
storage as a 3substring* 12 characters long.  So you shouldn't use
this for efficiency; it is intended for uses in which it is important
to have a substring which, if modified, will cause the original string
to be modified too.
.end_defun

.defun string-append &rest strings
Copies and concatenates any number of strings into a single string.
With a single argument, 3string-append* simply copies it.  If there
are no arguments, the value is an empty string.  In fact, vectors of any
type may be used as arguments, and the value is a vector capable of
holding all the elements of all the arguments.  Thus 3string-append*
can be used to copy and concatenate any type of vector.  If the first
argument is not an array (for example, if it is a character), the value
is a string.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-append #\! "foo" #\!) => "!foo!"
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-nconc modified-string &rest strings
Is like 3string-append* except that instead
of making a new string containing the concatenation of its arguments,
3string-nconc* modifies its first argument.  2modified-string*
must have a fill-pointer so that additional characters can be tacked
onto it.  Compare this with 3array-push-extend*
((array-push-extend-fun)).  The value of 3string-nconc* is
2modified-string* or a new, longer copy of it; in the latter case
the original copy is forwarded to the new copy (see 3adjust-array-size*,
(adjust-array-size-fun)).  Unlike 3nconc*, 3string-nconc*
with more than two arguments modifies only its first argument, not
every argument but the last.
.end_defun

.defun string-trim char-set string
Returns a 3substring* of 2string*, with all characters
in 2char-set* stripped off the beginning and end.
2char-set* is a set of characters, which can be represented as a list
of characters, a string of characters or a single character.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-trim '(#\sp) "  Dr. No  ") => "Dr. No"
(string-trim "ab" "abbafooabb") => "foo"
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-left-trim char-set string
Returns a 3substring* of 2string*, with all characters
in 2char-set* stripped off the beginning.
2char-set* is a set of characters, which can be represented as a list
of characters, a string of characters or a single character.
.end_defun

.defun string-right-trim char-set string
Returns a 3substring* of 2string*, with all characters
in 2char-set* stripped off the end.
2char-set* is a set of characters, which can be represented as a list
of characters, a string of characters or a single character.
.end_defun

.defun string-remove-fonts string
	Returns a copy of 2string* with each character truncated to 8
bits; that is, changed to font zero.

If 2string* is an ordinary string of array type 3art-string*, this
does not change anything, but it makes a difference if 2string* is an
3art-fat-string*.
.end_defun

.defun string-reverse string
.defun1 string-nreverse string
Like 3reverse* and 3nreverse*, but on strings only (see (reverse-fun)).
There is no longer any reason to use these functions except
that they coerce numbers
and symbols into strings like the other string functions.
.end_defun

.defun string-pluralize string
Returns a string containing the plural of the
word in the argument 2string*.  Any added characters go in the same
case as the last character of 2string*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-pluralize "event") => "events"
(string-pluralize "trufan") => "trufen"
(string-pluralize "Can") => "Cans"
(string-pluralize "key") => "keys"
(string-pluralize "TRY") => "TRIES"
.end_lisp
For words with multiple plural forms depending on the
meaning, 3string-pluralize* cannot always do the right thing.
.end_defun

.defun string-select-a-or-an word
Returns 3"a"* or 3"an"* according to the string 2word*;
whichever one appears to be correct to use before 2word* in English.
.end_defun

.defun string-append-a-or-an word
Returns the result of appending 3"a "* or 3"an "*, whichever is
appropriate, to the front of 2word*.
.end_defun

.defun %string-equal string1 start1 string2 start2 count
3%string-equal* is the microcode primitive used by 3string-equal*.
It returns 3t* if the 2count* characters of 2string1* starting
at 2start1* are 3char-equal* to the 2count* characters of 2string2*
starting at 2start2*, or 3nil* if the characters are not equal or
if 2count* runs off the length of either array.

Instead of a fixnum, 2count* may also be 3nil*.  In this case,
3%string-equal* compares
the substring from 2start1* to 3(string-length 2string1*)*
against the substring from 2start2* to 3(string-length 2string2*)*.
If the lengths of these substrings differ, then they are not equal and
3nil* is returned.

Note that 2string1* and 2string2* must really be strings; the
usual coercion of symbols and fixnums to strings is not performed.
This function is documented because certain programs which require
high efficiency and are willing to pay the price of less generality
may want to use 3%string-equal* in place of 3string-equal*.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
1To compare the two strings 2foo* and 2bar*:*
(%string-equal 2foo* 0 2bar* 0 nil)

(%string-equal 2foo* 0 "bar" 0 3)
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defvar alphabetic-case-affects-string-comparison
If this variable is 3t*, the functions 3%string-equal* and 3%string-search*
consider case (and font) significant in comparing characters.
Normally this variable is 3nil* and those primitives ignore differences of case.

This variable may be bound by user programs around calls to
3%string-equal* and 3%string-search-char*, but do not set it globally,
for that may cause system malfunctions.
.end_defvar

.section String Searching

.defun string-search-char char string &optional (from 30*) to consider-case
Searches through 2string* starting at the index 2from*,
which defaults to the beginning, and returns the index of the first
character that is 3char-equal* to 2char*, or 3nil* if none is found.
If 2to* is non-3nil*, it is used in place of 3(string-length 2string*)*
to limit the extent of the search.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-search-char #\a "banana") => 1
.end_lisp
Case (and font) is significant in comparison of characters if 2consider-case*
is non-3nil*.  In other words, characters are compared using 3char=* rather
than 3char-equal*.
.lisp
(string-search-char #\a "BAnana" 0 nil t) => 3
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun %string-search-char char string from to
3%string-search-char* is the microcode primitive called by 3string-search-char*
and other functions.  2string* must be an array and 2char*, 2from*,
and 2to* must be fixnums.  The arguments are all required.
Case-sensitivity is controlled by the value of the variable
3alphabetic-case-affects-string-comparison* rather than by an argument.
Except for these these differences, 3%string-search-char* is the same as
3string-search-char*.  This function is documented for the benefit of
those who require the maximum possible efficiency in string searching.
.end_defun

.defun string-search-not-char char string &optional (from 30*) to consider-case
Like 3string-search-char* but searches 2string* for a character different
from 2char*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-search-not-char #\B "banana") => 1
(string-search-not-char #\B "banana" 0 nil t) => 0
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-search key string &optional (from 30*) to (key-from 30*) key-to consider-case
Searches for the string 2key* in the string
2string*.
The search begins at 2from*, which defaults to the beginning of
2string*.  The value returned is the index of the first character of
the first instance of 2key*, or 3nil* if none is found.  If
2to* is non-3nil*, it is used in place of 3(string-length
2string*)* to limit the extent of the search.

The arguments 2key-from* and 2key-to* can be used to specify the
portion of 2key* to be searched for, rather than all of 2key*.

Case and font are significant in character
comparison if 2consider-case* is non-3nil*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-search "an" "banana") => 1
(string-search "an" "banana" 2) => 3
(string-search "tank" "banana" 2 nil 1 3) => 3
(string-search "an" "BAnaNA" 0 nil 0 nil t) => nil
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-search-set char-set string &optional (from 30*) to consider-case
Searches through 2string* looking for a character that is in
2char-set*.  2char-set* is a set of characters, which can be
represented as a sequence of characters or a single character.

The search begins at the index 2from*, which defaults to the
beginning.  It returns the index of the first character that is
3char-equal* to some element of 2char-set*, or 3nil* if none is
found.  If 2to* is non-3nil*, it is used in place of
3(string-length 2string*)* to limit the extent of the search.

Case and font are significant in character
comparison if 2consider-case* is non-3nil*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-search-set '(#\n #\o) "banana") => 2

(string-search-not-set '(#\a #\b) "banana") => 2
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-reverse-search-char char string &optional from (to 30*) consider-case
Searches through 2string* in reverse
order, starting from the index one less than 2from* (3nil* for
2from* starts at the end of 2string*), and returns the index of the
first character which is 3char-equal* to 2char*, or 3nil* if none
is found.  Note that the index returned is from the beginning of the
string, although the search starts from the end.
The last (leftmost) character of 2string* examined is the one at index 2to*.

Case and font are significant in character
comparison if 2consider-case* is non-3nil*.  In this case,
3char=* is used for the comparison rather than 3char-equal*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-reverse-search-char #\n "banana") => 4
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-reverse-search-not-char char string &optional from (to 30*) consider-case
Like 3string-reverse-search-char* but searches for a character in 2string*
that is different from 2char*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-reverse-search-not-char #\a "banana") => 4
;14 is the index of the second "n"*
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-reverse-search key string &optional from (to 30*) (key-from 30*) key-to consider-case
Searches for the string 2key* in the string 2string*.
The search proceeds in reverse order, starting
from the index one less than 2from*,
and returns the index of the first (leftmost) character of the first instance found,
or 3nil* if none is found.  Note that the index returned
is from the beginning of the string, although the search starts from the end.
The 2from* condition, restated, is that the instance of 2key* found
is the rightmost one whose rightmost character is before the 2from*'th character
of 2string*.  3nil* for 2from* means the search starts at the end of 2string*.
The last (leftmost) character of 2string* examined is the one at index 2to*.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-reverse-search "na" "banana") => 4
.end_lisp

The arguments 2key-from* and 2key-to* can be used to specify the
portion of 2key* to be searched for, rather than all of 2key*.
Case and font are significant in character
comparison if 2consider-case* is non-3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun string-reverse-search-set char-set string &optional from (to 30*) consider-case
Searches through 2string* in reverse order for a character
which is 3char-equal* to some element of 2char-set*.
2char-set* is a set of characters, which can be represented as a list
of characters, a string of characters or a single character.

The search starts from an index one less than 2from*, and returns the
index of the first suitable character found, or 3nil* if none is
found.  3nil* for 2from* means the search starts at the end of
2string*.  Note that the index returned is from the beginning of the
string, although the search starts from the end.  The last (leftmost)
character of 2string* examined is the one at index 2to*.

Case and font are significant in character
comparison if 2consider-case* is non-3nil*.  In this case,
3char=* is used for the comparison rather than 3char-equal*.

.lisp
(string-reverse-search-set "ab" "banana") => 5
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-reverse-search-not-set char-set string &optional from (to 30*) consider-case
Like 3string-reverse-search-set* but searches for a character which
is 2not* in 2char-set*.
.lisp
(string-reverse-search-not-set '(#\a #\n) "banana") => 0
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-subst-char new-char old-char string (copy-p 3t*) (retain-font-p 3t*)
Returns a copy of 2string* in which all occurrences of 2old-char*
have been replaced by 2new-char*.

Case and font are ignored in comparing 2old-char* against characters of 2string*.
Normally the font information of the character replaced is preserved, so that an 2old-char*
in font 3 is replaced by a 2new-char* in font 3.  If 2retain-font-p* is 3nil*,
the font specified in 2new-char* is stored whenever a character is replaced.

If 2copy-p* is 3nil*, 2string* is modified destructively and returned.
No copy is made.
.end_defun

.defun substring-after-char char string &optional start end area
Returns a copy of the portion of 2string* that follows the next
occurrence of 2char* after index 2start*.  The portion copied ends
at index 2end*.  If 2char* is not found before 2end*, a null
string is returned.

The value is consed in area 2area*, or in 3default-cons-area*,
unless it is a null string.
2start* defaults to zero, and 2end* to the length of 2string*.
.end_defun

See also 3make-symbol* ((make-symbol-fun)), which given a string makes
a new uninterned symbol with that print name, and 3intern*
((intern-fun)), which given a string returns the one and only symbol
(in the current package) with that print name.

.section Maclisp-Compatible Functions

The following functions are provided primarily for Maclisp compatibility.

.defun alphalessp string1 string2
3(alphalessp 2string1 string2*)* is equivalent to
3(string-lessp 2string1 string2*)*.
.end_defun

.defun samepnamep sym1 sym2
This predicate is equivalent to 3string=*.
.end_defun

.defun getchar string index
	Returns the 2index*'th character of 2string*
as a symbol.  Note that 1-origin indexing is used.  This function
is mainly for Maclisp compatibility; 3aref* should be used
to index into strings (but 3aref* does not coerce symbols
or numbers into strings).
.end_defun

.defun getcharn string index
	Returns the 2index*'th character of 2string*
as a fixnum.  Note that 1-origin indexing is used.  This function
is mainly for Maclisp compatibility; 3aref* should be used
to index into strings (but 3aref* does not coerce symbols
or numbers into strings).
.end_defun

.defun ascii x
Like 3character*, but returns a symbol
whose printname is the character instead of returning a fixnum.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(ascii #o101) => A
(ascii #o56) => /.
.end_lisp
The symbol returned is interned in the current package (see (package)).
.end_defun

.defun maknam char-list
Returns
an uninterned symbol whose print-name is a string made up of the characters in 2char-list*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(maknam '(a b #\0 d)) => ab0d
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun implode char-list
	3implode* is like 3maknam* except that the returned symbol
is interned in the current package.
.end_defun
