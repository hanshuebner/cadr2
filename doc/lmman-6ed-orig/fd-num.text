.cindex number
Zetalisp includes several types of numbers, with different
characteristics.  Most numeric functions accept any type of numbers as
arguments and do the right thing.  That is to say, they are 2generic*.
In Maclisp, there are generic numeric functions (like 3plus*) and there
are specific numeric functions (like 3+*) which only operate on a certain
type of number, but are much more efficient.
In Zetalisp, this distinction does not exist; both function
names exist for compatibility but they are identical.  The microprogrammed
structure of the machine makes it possible to have only the generic
functions without loss of efficiency. 

.cindex fixnum
.cindex bignum
.cindex ratio
.cindex float
.cindex short float
.cindex complexnum

The types of numbers in Zetalisp are:
.table 1
.item fixnum
Fixnums are 25-bit twos-complement binary integers.  These are the preferred,
most efficient type of number.
.item bignum
Bignums are arbitrary-precision binary integers.
.item ratio
Ratios represent rational numbers exactly as the quotient of two
integers, each of which can be a fixnum or a bignum.  Ratios with
a denominator of one are not normally created, as an integer is returned instead.
.item single-float or full-size float
Full size floats are floating-point numbers.  They have a mantissa of 31 bits and an exponent
of 11 bits, providing a precision of about 9 digits and a range of about 10^300.
Stable rounding is employed.
.item short-float
Short floats are another form of floating-point number, with a mantissa of
17 bits and an exponent of 8 bits, providing a precision of about 5 digits
and a range of about 10^38.  Stable rounding is employed.
Short floats are useful because, like fixnums,
and unlike full-size floats, they don't require any storage.  Computing with short floats is
more efficient than with full-size floats because the operations are faster
and consing overhead is eliminated.
.item complexnum
Complexnums represent complex numbers with a real part and an imaginary
part, which can be any type of number except complexnums.  (They must be
both rational or both floats of the same type).  It is impossible to
make a complexnum whose real part is rational and whose imaginary part
is the intreger zero; it is always changed into a real number. However, it 2is*
possible to create complexnums with an imaginary part of 0.0, and such numbers may result from
calculations involving complexnums. In fact, 5.0 and 5.0+0.0i are 2always* distinct;
they are not 3eql*, and arithmetic operations will never canonicalize a complexnum
with floating-point zero imaginary part into a real number.
.end_table

Generally, Lisp objects have a unique identity; each exists, independent
of any other, and you can use the 3eq* predicate to determine whether
two references are to the same object or not.  Numbers are the exception
to this rule; they don't work this way.  The following function may return
either 3t* or 3nil*.  Its behavior is considered undefined;
as this manual is written, it returns 3t* when interpreted but 3nil* when compiled.
.lisp
(defun foo ()
   (let ((x (float 5)))
     (eq x (car (cons x nil)))))
.end_lisp
This is very strange from the point of view of Lisp's usual object
semantics, but the implementation works this way, in order to gain
efficiency, and on the grounds that identity testing of numbers is not
really an interesting thing to do.  So the rule is that the result
of applying 3eq* to numbers is undefined, and may return either
3t* or 3nil* on what appear to be two pointers to the same
numeric object.  The only reasonable ways to compare numbers are
3=* (see (=-fun)) and 3eql* ((eql-fun)), and other
things (3equal* or 3equalp*) based on them.

Conversely, fixnums and short floats have the unusual property that
they are always 3eq* if they are equal in value.  This is because
they do not point to storage; the ``pointer'' field of a fixnum is actually
its numeric value, and likewise for short floats.  Stylisticly it is
better to avoid depending on this, by using 3eql* rather than
3eq*.  Also, comparing floats of any sort for exact equality, even
with 3=* which is guaranteed to consider only the numeric values, is
usually unwise since round-off error can make the answer unpredictable
and meaningless.

The distinction between fixnums and bignums is largely transparent to
the user.  The user simply computes with integers, and the system
represents some as fixnums and the rest (less efficiently) as bignums.
The system automatically converts back and forth between fixnums and
bignums based solely on the size of the integer.  There are a few low
level functions which only work on fixnums; this fact is noted in
their documentation.  Also, when using 3eq* on numbers the user
needs to be aware of the fixnum/bignum distinction.

Integer computations cannot overflow, except for division by zero,
since bignums can be of arbitrary size.  Floating-point computations
can get exponent overflow or underflow, if the result is too large or small
to be represented.  Exponent overflow always signals an error.
Exponent underflow normally signals an error, and assumes 30.0* as the answer
if the user says to proceed from the error.  However, if the value of the
variable 3zunderflow* is non-3nil*, the error is skipped
and computation proceeds with 30.0* in place of the result that was too small.

When an arithmetic function of more than one argument is given arguments
of different numeric types, uniform 2coercion rules* are followed to
convert the arguments to a common type, which is also the type of the
result (for functions which return a number).  When an integer meets a
ratio, the result is a ratio.  When an integer or ratio meets a float,
the result is a float of the same sort.  When a short-float meets a
full-size float, the result is a full-size float.

If any argument of the arithmetic function is complex, the other
arguments are converted to complex.
The components of a complex result must be both full-size floats,
both small-floats, or both rational; if they differ, the one
whose type comes last in that list is converted to match the other.
Finally, if the components of the result are rational and the imaginary part is
zero, the result is simply the real part.  If, however, the components
are floats, the value is always complex even if the imaginary part is zero.

Thus if the constants in a numerical algorithm are written as
short floats (assuming this provides adequate precision), and if the input
is a short float, the computation is done with short floats and
the result is a short float, while if the input is a full-size float
the computation is done in full precision and the result is
a full-size float.

Zetalisp never automatically converts between full-size floats and short
floats in the same way as it automatically converts between fixnums and
bignums since this would lead either to inefficiency or to unexpected
numerical inaccuracies.  (When a short float meets a full-size float, the result
is a full-size float, but if you use only one type, all the results are of
the same type too.)  This means that a short float computation can get
an exponent overflow error even when the result could have been
represented as a full-size float.

Floating-point numbers retain only a certain number of bits of precision;
therefore, the results of computations are only approximate.  Full-size floats
have 31 bits and short floats have 17 bits, not counting the sign.
The method of approximation is ``stable rounding''.  The result of an
arithmetic operation is the float which is closest to the exact
value.  If the exact result falls precisely halfway between two representable floats,
the result is rounded down if the least-significant bit is 0,
or up if the least-significant bit is 1.  This choice is arbitrary
but insures that no systematic bias is introduced.

Unlike Maclisp, Zetalisp does not have number declarations in
the compiler.  Note that because fixnums and short floats require no
associated storage they are as efficient as declared numbers in Maclisp.
Bignums and full-size floats are less efficient; however, bignum and
float intermediate results are garbage-collected in a special way that
avoids the overhead of the full garbage collector.

The different types of numbers can be distinguished by their printed
representations.  If a number has an exponent separated by `3s*', it
is a short float.  If a number has an exponent separated by `3f*', it
is a full-size float.  A leading or embedded (but 2not* trailing)
decimal point, and/or an exponent separated by `3e*', indicates a
float; which kind is controlled by the variable
3*read-default-float-format**, which is usually set to specify
full-size floats.  Short floats require a special indicator so that
naive users will not accidentally compute with the lesser precision.
Fixnums and bignums have similar printed representations since there is
no numerical value that has a choice of whether to be a fixnum or a
bignum; an integer is a bignum if and only if its magnitude is too big
for a fixnum.  See the examples on (flonum-examples), in the
description of what the reader understands.

.defvar zunderflow
When this is 3nil*, floating point exponent underflow is an error.
When this is 3t*, exponent underflow proceeds, returning zero as the value.
The same thing could be accomplished with a condition handler.
However, 3zunderflow* is useful for Maclisp compatibility, and is also faster.
.end_defvar

.defcondition sys:floating-exponent-overflow (3sys:arithmetic-error* 3error*)
.defcondition1 sys:floating-exponent-underflow (3sys:arithmetic-error* 3error*)
3sys:floating-exponent-overflow* is signaled when the result of an
arithmetic operation should be a floating point number, but the exponent
is too large to be represented in the format to be used for the value.
3sys:floating-exponent-underflow* is signaled when the exponent is too
small.

The condition instance provides two additional operations:
3:function*, which returns the arithmetic function that was called,
and 3:small-float-p*, which is 3t* if the result was supposed to be
a short float.

3sys:floating-exponent-overflow* provides the 3:new-value* proceed
type.  It expects one argument, a new value.

3sys:floating-exponent-underflow* provides the 3:use-zero* proceed
type, which expects no argument.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to make the arguments to the operation
available.  Perhaps someday they will be.
.end_defcondition

.section Numeric Predicates
.defun zerop x
Returns 3t* if 2x* is zero.  Otherwise it returns 3nil*.
If 2x* is not a number, 3zerop* causes an error.  For floats,
this only returns 3t* for exactly 30.0* or 30.0s0*.
For complex numbers, it returns 3t* if both real and imaginary
parts are zero.
.end_defun

.defun plusp x
Returns 3t* if its argument is a positive number, strictly greater
than zero.  Otherwise it returns 3nil*.
If 2x* is not a number, 3plusp* causes an error.
.end_defun

.defun minusp x
Returns 3t* if its argument is a negative number, strictly
less than zero.  Otherwise it returns 3nil*.
If 2x* is not a number, 3minusp* causes an error.
.end_defun

.defun oddp number
Returns 3t* if 2number* is odd, otherwise 3nil*.
If 2number* is not a fixnum or a bignum, 3oddp* causes an error.
.end_defun

.defun evenp number
Returns 3t* if 2number* is even, otherwise 3nil*.
If 2number* is not a fixnum or a bignum, 3evenp* causes an error.
.end_defun

.defspec signp test x
Tests the sign of a number.  3signp* is present only for
Maclisp compatibility and is not recommended for use in new programs.
3signp* returns 3t* if 2x* is a number which
satisfies the 2test*, 3nil* if it is not a number or does not meet
the test.  2test* is not evaluated, but 2x* is.  2test* can be
one of the following:
.table 3 500 250 0 0
.item l
x < 0
.item le
x 3* 0
.item e
x = 0
.item n
x 3* 0
.item ge
x 3* 0
.item g
x > 0
.end_table
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(signp ge 12) => t
(signp le 12) => nil
(signp n 0) => nil
(signp g 'foo) => nil
.end_lisp
.end_defspec

See also the data-type predicates 3integerp*, 3rationalp*,
3realp*, 3complexp*,
3floatp*, 3bigp*, 3small-floatp*, and 3numberp* ((fixp-fun)).

.section Numeric Comparisons

All of these functions require that their arguments be numbers; they signal
an error if given a non-number.  Equality tests work on all types of numbers,
automatically performing any required coercions (as opposed to
Maclisp in which generally only the spelled-out names work for
all kinds of numbers).  Ordering comparisons allow only real numbers,
since they are meaningless on complex numbers.

.defun = &rest numbers
Returns 3t* if all the arguments are numerically equal.  They need not
be of the same type; 1 and 1.0 are considered equal.  Character objects
are also allowed, and in effect coerced to integers for comparison.
.end_defun

See also 3eql*, (eql-fun), which insists that both the type and the value
match when its arguments are numbers.

.defun > &rest numbers
.defun1 greaterp &rest numbers
3>* compares each pair of successive arguments.  If any argument
is not greater than the next, 3>* returns 3nil*.  But if the
arguments are monotonically strictly decreasing, the result is 3t*.
Zero arguments are always monotonically decreasing, and so is
a single argument.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(>) => t
(> 3) => t
(> 4 3) => t
(> 4 3 2 1 0) => t
(> 4 3 1 2 0) => nil
.end_lisp

3greaterp* is the Maclisp name for this function.
.end_defun

.defun >= &rest numbers
.defun1  &rest numbers
3* compares each pair of successive arguments.  If any argument
is less than the next, 3* returns 3nil*.  But if the
arguments are monotonically decreasing or equal, the result is 3t*.

3>=* is the Common Lisp name for this function.
.end_defun

.defun < &rest numbers
.defun1 lessp &rest numbers
3<* compares each pair of successive arguments.  If any argument
is not less than the next, 3<* returns 3nil*.  But if the
arguments are monotonically strictly increasing, the result is 3t*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(<) => t
(< 3) => t
(< 3 4) => t
(< 1 1) => nil
(< 0 1 2 3 4) => t
(< 0 1 3 2 4) => nil
.end_lisp

3lessp* is the Maclisp name for this function.
.end_defun

.defun <= &rest numbers
.defun1  &rest numbers
3* compares its arguments from left to right.  If any argument
is greater than the next, 3* returns 3nil*.  But if the
arguments are monotonically increasing or equal, the result is 3t*.

3<=* is the Common Lisp name for this function.
.end_defun

.defun  &rest numbers
.defun1 //= &rest numbers
3t* if no two arguments are numerically equal.
This is the same as 3(not (= ...))* when there are two arguments,
but not when there are more than two.

With zero or one argument, the value is always 3t*, since
there is no pair of arguments that fail to be equal.

3//=* is the Common Lisp name for this function.
In Common Lisp syntax, it would be written 3/=*.
.end_defun

.defun max &rest one-or-more-args
Returns the largest of its arguments, which must not be complex.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(max 1 3 2) => 3
.end_lisp
3max* requires at least one argument.
.end_defun

.defun min &rest one-or-more-args
Returns the smallest of its arguments, which must not be complex.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(min 1 3 2) => 1
.end_lisp
3min* requires at least one argument.
.end_defun

.section Arithmetic

All of these functions require that their arguments be numbers, and signal
an error if given a non-number.  They work on all types of numbers,
automatically performing any required coercions (as opposed to Maclisp,
in which generally only the spelled-out versions work for all kinds
of numbers, and the `3$*' versions are needed for floats).

.defun + &rest args
.defun1 plus &rest args
.defun1 +$ &rest args
Returns the sum of its arguments.  If there are no arguments, it returns
30*, which is the identity for this operation.

3plus* and 3$+* are Maclisp names, supported for
compatibility.
.end_defun

.defun - arg &rest args
.defun1 -$ arg &rest args
With only one argument, 3-* returns the negative of its argument.
With more than one argument, 3-* returns its first argument minus
all of the rest of its arguments.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(- 1) => -1
(- -3.0) => 3.0
(- 3 1) => 2
(- 9 2 1) => 6
.end_lisp

3-$* is a Maclisp name, supported for compatibility.
.end_defun

.defun minus x
Returns the negative of 2x*, just like 3-* with one argument.
.end_defun

.defun difference arg &rest args
Returns its first argument minus all of the rest of its arguments.
If there are at least two arguments, 3difference* is equivalent to
3-*.
.end_defun

.defun abs x
Returns 3|2x*|*, the absolute value of the number 2x*.
3abs* for real numbers could have been defined as
.lisp
(defun abs (x)
    (cond ((minusp x) (minus x))
	  (t x)))
.end_lisp

3abs* of a complex number could be computed, though imprecisely, as
.lisp
(sqrt (^ (realpart x) 2) (^ (imagpart x) 2))
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun * &rest args
.defun1 times &rest args
.defun1 *$ &rest args
Returns the product of its arguments.  If there are no arguments, it
returns 31*, which is the identity for this operation.

3times* and 3*$* are Maclisp names, supported for compatibility.
.end_defun

.defun // arg &rest args
.defun1 //$ arg &rest args
With more than one argument, 3//*
it returns the first argument divided by all of the rest of its arguments.
With only one argument, 3(// 2x*)* is the same as 3(// 1 2x*)*.

The name of this function is written 3//* rather than 3/* because
3/* is the escape character in traditional Lisp syntax and must be
escaped in order to suppress that significance.  3//$* is a Maclisp
name, supported for compatibility.

3//* of two integers returns an integer even if the mathematically
correct value is not an integer.  More precisely, the value is the
same as the first value returned by 3truncate* (see below).  This
will eventually be changed, and then the value will be a ratio if
necessary so that the it is mathematically correct.  All code that
relies on 3//* to return an integer value rather than a ratio should
be converted to use 3truncate* (or 3floor* or 3ceiling*, which
may simplify the code further).  In the mean time, use the function
3cli://* if you want a rational result.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(// 3 2) => 1       1;Fixnum division truncates.*
(// 3 -2) => -1
(// -3 2) => -1
(// -3 -2) => 1
(// 3 2.0) => 1.5
(// 3 2.0s0) => 1.5s0
(// 4 2) => 2
(// 12. 2. 3.) => 2
(// 4.0) => .25
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun quotient arg &rest args
Returns the first argument divided by all of the rest of its arguments.
When there are two or more arguments, 3quotient* is equivalent to
3//*.
.end_defun

.defun cli:// number &rest numbers
This is the Common Lisp division function.  It is like 3//* except
that it uses exact rational division when the arguments are integers.

3//* will someday be changed to divide integers exactly.  Then there
will no longer be a distinct function 3cli://*; that name will become
equivalent to 3//*.

Note that in Common Lisp syntax you would write just 3/* rather than
3cli://*.
.end_defun

There are four functions for ``integer division'', the sort which
produces a quotient and a remainder.  They differ in how they round the
quotient to an integer, and therefore also in the sign of the remainder.
The arguments must be real, since ordering is needed to compute the
value.  The quotient is always an integer, but the arguments and remainder
need not be.

.defun floor x &optional (y 31*)
3floor*'s first value is the largest integer less than or equal to the
quotient of 2x* divided by 2y*.

The second value is the remainder, 2x* minus 2y* times the first
value.  This has the same sign as 2y* (or may be zero), regardless of
the sign of 2x*.

With one argument, 3floor*'s first value is the largest integer less than
or equal to the argument.
.end_defun

.defun ceiling x &optional (y 31*)
3ceiling*'s first value is the smallest integer greater than or equal
to the quotient of 2x* divided by 2y*.

The second value is the remainder, 2x* minus 2y* times the first
value.  This has the opposite sign from 2y* (or may be zero),
regardless of the sign of 2x*.

With one argument, 3ceiling*'s first value is the smallest integer greater than
or equal to the argument.
.end_defun

.defun truncate x &optional (y 31*)
3truncate* is the same as 3floor* if the arguments have the same
sign, 3ceiling* if they have opposite signs.  3truncate* is the
function that the divide instruction on most computers implements.

3truncate*'s first value is the nearest integer, in the direction of
zero, to the quotient of 2x* divided by 2y*.

The second value is the remainder, 2x* minus 2y* times the first
value.  This has the same sign as 2x* (or may be zero).
.end_defun

.defun round x &optional (y 31*)
3round*'s first value is the nearest integer 
to the quotient of 2x* divided by 2y*.  If the quotient is midway
between two integers, the even integer of the two is used.

The second value is the remainder, 2x* minus 2y* times the first
value.  The sign of this remainder cannot be predicted from the signs of
the arguments alone.

With one argument, 3round*'s first value is the integer nearest to the
argument.
.end_defun

.nopara
Here is a table which clarifies the meaning of 3floor*, 3ceiling*,
3truncate* and 3round* with one argument:

.lisp
           floor   ceiling   truncate    round

  2.6        2         3         2         3

 -2.6       -3        -2        -2        -3
.end_lisp

There are two kinds of remainder function, which differ in the treatment
of negative numbers.  The remainder can also be obtained as the second
value of one of the integer division functions above, but if only the
remaineder is desired it is simpler to use these functions.

.defun \ x y
.defun1 remainder x y
.defun1 cli:rem x y
Returns the remainder of 2x* divided by 2y*.
2x* and 2y* must be integers (fixnums or bignums).
This is the same as the second value of 3(truncate 2x* 2y*)*.
Only the absolute value of the divisor is relevant.
.lisp
(\ 3 2) => 1
(\ -3 2) => -1
(\ 3 -2) => 1
(\ -3 -2) => -1
.end_lisp

Common Lisp gives this function the name 3rem*, but since 3rem* in
traditional Zetalisp is a function to remove elements from lists (see
(rem-fun)), the name 3rem* is defined to mean remainder only in Common
Lisp programs.  Note that the name 3\* would have to be written as
3\\* in Common Lisp syntax; but the function 3\* is not standard
Common Lisp.
.end_defun

.defun mod number divisor
Returns the root of 2number* modulo 2divisor*.  This is a number
between 0 and 2divisor*, or possibly 0, whose difference from
2number* is a multiple of 2divisor*.  It is the same as the second
value of 3(floor 2number* 2divisor*)*.  Examples:
.lisp
(mod 2 5)  =>  2
(mod -2 5)  =>  3
(mod -2 -5)  =>  -2
(mod 2 -5)  =>  -3
.end_lisp
.end_defun

There are four ``floating point integer division'' functions.
These produce a result which is a floating point number whose value
is exactly integral.

.defun ffloor x &optional (y 31*)
.defun1 fceiling x &optional (y 31*)
.defun1 ftruncate x &optional (y 31*)
.defun1 fround x &optional (y 31*)
Like 3floor*, 3ceiling*, 3truncate* and 3round* except
that the first value is converted from an integer to a float.
If 2x* is a float, then the result is the same type of float as 2x*.
.end_defun

.defcondition sys:divide-by-zero (3sys:arithmetic-error* 3error*)
Dividing by zero, using any of the above division functions, signals this
condition.  The 3:function* operation on the condition instance
returns the name of the division function.  The 3:dividend* operation
may be available to return the number that was divided.
.end_defcondition

.defun 1+ x
.defun1 add1 x
.defun1 1+$ x
3(1+ x)* is the same as 3(+ x 1)*.  The other two names
are for Maclisp compatibility.
.end_defun

.defun 1- x
.defun1 sub1 x
.defun1 1-$ x
3(1- x)* is the same as 3(- x 1)*.  Note that the
short name may be confusing: 3(1- 2x*)* does 2not* mean 1-2x*;
rather, it means 2x*-1.  The names 3sub1* and 31-$* are
for Maclisp compatibility.
.end_defun

.defun gcd &rest integers
.defun1 \\ &rest integers
Returns the greatest common divisor of all its arguments,
which must be integers.
With one argument, the value is that argument.  With no arguments,
the value is zero.

In Common Lisp syntax 3\\* would be written as 3\\\\*,
but only the name 3gcd* is valid in strict Common Lisp.
.end_defun

.defun lcm integer &rest more-integers
Returns the least common multiple of the specified integers.
.end_defun

.defun expt x y
.defun1 ^ x y
.defun1 ^$ x y
Returns 2x* raised to the 2y*'th power.  The result is rational (and
possibly an integer) if 2x* is rational and 2y* an integer.  If the exponent is
an integer a repeated-squaring algorithm is used; otherwise the result
is 3(exp (* 2y* (log 2x*)))*.

If 2y* is zero, the result is 3(+ 1 (* 2x* 2y*))*;
this is equal to one, but its type depends on those of 2x* and 2y*.
.end_defun

.defcondition sys:zero-to-negative-power (3sys:arithmetic-error* 3error*)
This condition is signaled when 3expt*'s first argument is zero
and the second argument is negative.
.end_defcondition

.defun sqrt x
Returns the square root of 2x*.  A mathematically unavoidable
discontinuity occurs for negative real arguments, for which the value
returned is a positive real times 3i*.
.lisp
(sqrt 4) => 2
(sqrt -4) => 0+2i
(sqrt -4+.0001i) => .00005+2i 1(approximately)*
(sqrt -4-.0001i) => .00005-2i 1(approximately)*
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun isqrt x
Integer square-root.  2x* must be an integer; the result is the greatest
integer less than or equal to the exact square root of 2x*.
.end_defun

.defun *dif x y
.defun1 *plus x y
.defun1 *quo x y
.defun1 *times x y
These are the internal microcoded arithmetic functions.  There is no
reason why anyone should need to write code with these explicitly, since the
compiler knows how to generate the appropriate code for 3plus*,
3+*, etc.  These names are only here for Maclisp compatibility.
.end_defun

.defun %div dividend divisor
The internal division function used by 3cli://*,
it was available before 3cli://* was and may therefore
be used in some programs.  It takes exactly two arguments.
Uses of 3%div* should be changed to use 3cli://*.
.end_defun

.section Complex Number Functions

See also the predicates 3realp* and 3complexp* ((complexp-fun)).

.defun complex x &optional y
Returns the complex number whose real part is 2x* and whose imaginary
part is 2y*.

If 2x* is rational and 2y* is zero or omitted, the value is 2x*,
and not a complex number at all.
If 2x* is a float and 2y* is zero or omitted, of if 2y* is
a floating zero, the result is a complexnum whose imaginary part is zero.
.end_defun

.defun realpart z
Returns the real part of the number 2z*.  If 2z* is real,
this is the same as 2z*.
.end_defun

.defun imagpart z
Returns the imaginary part of the number 2z*.  If 2z* is real, this
is zero.
.end_defun

.defun conjugate z
Returns the complex conjugate of the number 2z*.  If 2z* is real,
this is the same as 2z*.
.end_defun

.defun phase z
Returns the phase angle of the complex number 2z* in its polar form.
This is the angle from the positive 2x* axis to the ray from the
origin through 2z*.  The value is always in the interval 3(-, ]*.
.lisp
(phase -4) => 
(phase -4-.0001i) 1is just over 3-*.*
(phase 0) => 0 1(an arbitrary choice)*
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun cis angle
Returns the complex number of unit magnitude whose phase is 2angle*.
This is equal to 3(complex (cos 2angle*) (sin 2angle*))*.
2angle* must be real.
.end_defun

.defun signum z
Returns a number with unit magnitude and the same type and phase as 2z*.  If
2z* is zero, the value is zero.

If 2z* is real, the value is 3=* to 31* or 3-1*;
it may be a float, however.
.end_defun

.section Transcendental Functions

These functions are only for floating-point arguments; if given an integer
they convert it to a float.  If given a short float, they return a
short float.

.defconst pi
The value of 3*, as a full-size float.
.end_defconst

.defun exp x
Returns 2e* raised to the 2x*'th power, where 2e* is the base of natural logarithms.
.end_defun

.defun log x &optional base
Returns the logarithm of 2x* to base 2base*.  2base*
defaults to 2e*.  When 2base* is 2e*, the imaginary
part of the value is in the interval 3(-, ]*; for
negative real 2x*, the value has imaginary part 3*.

If 2base* is specified, the result is
.lisp
(// (log 2x*) (log 2base*))
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defcondition sys:zero-log (3sys:arithmetic-error* 3error*)
This is signaled when the argument to 3log* is zero.
.end_defcondition

.defun sin x
.defun1 cos x
.defun1 tan x
Return, respectively, the sine, cosine and tangent of 2x*, where
2x* is expressed in radians.  2x* may be complex.
.end_defun

.defun sind x
.defun1 cosd x
.defun1 tand x
Return, respectively, the sine, cosine and tangent of 2x*, where
2x* is expressed in degrees.
.end_defun

.defun asin x
.defun1 acos x
Returns the angle (in radians) whose sine (respectively, cosine)
is 2x*.  The real part of the result of 3asin* is
between 3-/2* and 3/2*; 3acos* and 3asin*
of any given argument always add up to 3/2*.
.end_defun

.defun atan y &optional x
If only 2y* is given, the value is the angle, in radians, whose
tangent is 2y*.  The real part of the result is between zero and 3-*.

If 2x* is also given, both arguments must be real, and the value is
an angle, in radians, whose tangent is 2y/x*.  However, the signs
of the two arguments are used to choose between two angles which
differ by 3* and have the same tangent.  The one chosen is the
angle from the 2x*-axis counterclockwise to the line from the origin
to the point (2x*, 2y*).

3atan* always returns a non-negative number between zero and
32*.
.end_defun

.defun atan2 y &optional x
.defun1 cli:atan y &optional x
Like 3atan* but always returns a value whose real part is between
3-/2* and 3/2*.  The value is either the same as
the value of 3atan* or differs from it by 3*.

3atan2* is the traditional name of this function.
In Common Lisp it is called 3atan*; it is documented as
3cli:atan* since the name 3atan* has a different meaning
in traditional syntax.
.end_defun

.defun sinh x
.defun1 cosh x
.defun1 tanh x
.defun1 asinh x
.defun1 acosh x
.defun1 atanh x
The hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions.
.end_defun

.section Numeric Type Conversions

These functions are provided to allow specific conversions of data
types to be forced, when desired.

.defun float number &optional float
Converts 2number* to a floating point number and returns it.

If 2float* is specified, the result is of the same
floating point format as 2float*.  If 2number* is
a float of a different format then it is converted.

If 2float* is omitted, then 2number* is converted to
a single-float unless it is already a floating point number.

A complex number is converted to one whose real and imaginary
parts are full-size floats unless they are already both floats.
.end_defun

.defun small-float x
.defun1 short-float x
Converts any kind of real number to a short-float.
A complex number is converted to one whose real and imaginary
parts are short floats.  The two names are synonymous.
.end_defun

.defun numerator x
Returns the numerator of the rational number 2x*.  If 2x* is an
integer, the value equals 2x*.  If 2x* is not an integer or
ratio, an error is signaled.
.end_defun

.defun denominator x
Returns the denominator of the rational number 2x*.  If 2x* is an
integer, the value is 31*.  If 2x* is not an integer or
ratio, an error is signaled.
.end_defun

.defun rational x
Converts 2x* to a rational number.  If 2x* is an integer or a
ratio, it is returned unchanged.  If it is a floating point
number, it is regarded as an exact fraction whose numerator is
the mantissa and whose denominator is a power of two.
For any other argument, an error is signaled.
.end_defun

.defun rationalize x &optional precision
Returns a rational approximation to 2x*.

If there is only one argument, and it is an integer or a ratio, it
is returned unchanged.  If the argument is a floating point number,
a rational number is returned which, if converted to a floating point
number, would produce the original argument.  Of all such rational
numbers, the one chosen has the smallest numerator and denominator.

If there are two arguments, the second one specifies how much precision
of the first argument should be considered significant.  2precision*
can be a positive integer (the number of bits to use), a negative integer
(the number of bits to drop at the end), or a floating point number
(minus its exponent is the number of bits to use).

If there are two arguments and the first is rational, the value is a
``simpler'' rational which approximates it.
.end_defun

.defun fix x
Converts 2x* from a float or ratio to an integer,
truncating towards negative infinity.
The result is a fixnum or a bignum as appropriate.  If 2x* is already
a fixnum or a bignum, it is returned unchanged.

3fix* is the same as 3floor* except that 3floor* returns an
additional value.  3fix* is semi-obsolete, since the functions 3floor*,
3ceiling*, 3truncate* and 3round* provide four different ways of
converting numbers to integers with different kinds of rounding.
.end_defun

.defun fixr x
3fixr* is the same as 3round* except that 3round* returns an
additional value.  3fixr* is considered obsolete.
.end_defun

.section Floating Point Numbers

.defun decode-float float
Returns three values which describe the value of 2float*.

The first value is a positive float of the same format having the same
mantissa, but with an exponent chosen to make it between 1/2 and 1, less
than 1.

The second value is the exponent of 2float*: the power of 2 by which
the first value needs to be scaled in order to get 2float* back.

The third value expresses the sign of 2float*.  It is a float of the
same format as 2float*, whose value is either 1 or -1.  Example:
.lisp
(decode-float 38.2)
  =>  0.596875   6   1.0
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun integer-decode-float float
Like 3decode-float* except that the first value is scaled so as to
make it an integer, and the second value is modified by addition of a
constant to compensate.
.lisp
(integer-decode-float 38.2)
  =>  #o11431463146   -25.   1.0
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun scale-float float integer
Multiplies 2float* by 2 raised to the 2integer* power.  2float* can actually be
an integer also; it is converted to a float and then scaled.
.lisp
(scale-float 0.596875 6)  =>  38.2
(scale-float #o11431463146 -25.)  =>  38.2
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun float-sign float1 &optional float2
Returns a float whose sign matches that of 2float1* and whose
magnitude and format are those of 2float2*.  If 2float2* is omitted,
1.0 is used as the magnitude and 2float1*'s format is used.
.lisp
(float-sign -1.0s0 35.3)  =>  -35.3
(float-sign -1.0s0 35.3s0)  =>  -35.3s0
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun float-radix float
Defined by Common Lisp to return the radix used for the exponent in the
format used for 2float*.  On the Lisp Machine, floating point
exponents are always powers of 2, so 3float-radix* ignores its
argument and always returns 2.
.end_defun

.defun float-digits float
Returns the number of bits of mantissa in the floating point format
which float is an example of.  It is 17 for short floats and 31 for
full size ones.
.end_defun

.defun float-precision float
Returns the number of significant figures present in in the mantissa of 2float*.
This is always the same as 3(float-digits 2float*)* for normalized numbers,
and on the Lisp Machine all floats are normalized, so the two functions are the same.
.end_defun

.section Logical Operations on Numbers

Except for 3lsh* and 3rot*, these functions operate on both
fixnums and bignums.  3lsh* and 3rot* have an inherent word-length
limitation and hence only operate on 25-bit fixnums.  Negative numbers
are operated on in their 2's-complement representation.

.defun logior &rest integers
Returns the bit-wise logical 2inclusive or* of its arguments.
With no arguments, the value is zero, which is the identity for this
operation.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example (in octal):
(logior #o4002 #o67) => #o4067
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun logand &rest integers
Returns the bit-wise logical 2and* of its arguments.
With no arguments, the value is -1, which is the identity for this operation.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples (in octal):
(logand #o3456 #o707) => #o406
(logand #o3456 #o-100) => #o3400
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun logxor &rest integers
Returns the bit-wise logical 2exclusive or* of its arguments.
With no arguments, the value is zero, which is the identity for this operation.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example (in octal):
(logxor #o2531 #o7777) => #o5246
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun logeqv &rest integers
Combines the 2integers* together bitwise using the equivalence
operation, which, for two arguments, is defined to result in 1 if the
two argument bits are equal.  This operation is asociative.  With no
args, the value is -1, which is an identity for the equivalence
operation.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example (in octal):
(logeqv #o2531 #o7707) => #o-5237 = ...77772541
.end_lisp
.end_defun

Non-associative bitwise operations take only two arguments:

.defun lognand integer1 integer2
Returns the bitwise-nand of the two arguments.  A bit of the result is 1
if at least one of the corresponding argument bits is 0.
.end_defun

.defun lognor integer1 integer2
Returns the bitwise-nor of the two arguments.  A bit of the result is 1
if both of the corresponding argument bits are 0.
.end_defun

.defun logorc1 integer1 integer2
Returns the bitwise-or of 2integer2* with the complement of 2integer1*.
.end_defun

.defun logorc2 integer1 integer2
Returns the bitwise-or of 2integer1* with the complement of 2integer2*.
.end_defun

.defun logandc1 integer1 integer2
Returns the bitwise-and of 2integer2* with the complement of 2integer1*.
.end_defun

.defun logandc2 integer1 integer2
Returns the bitwise-and of 2integer1* with the complement of 2integer2*.
.end_defun

.defun lognot number
Returns the logical complement of 2number*.  This is the same as
3logxor*'ing 2number* with -1.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(lognot #o3456) => #o-3457
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun boole fn &rest one-or-more-args
3boole* is the generalization of 3logand*, 3logior*, and 3logxor*.
2fn* should be a fixnum between 0 and 17 octal inclusive;
it controls the function which is computed.  If the binary representation
of 2fn* is 2abcd* (2a* is the most significant bit, 2d* the least)
then the truth table for the Boolean operation is as follows:
.sp
.lisp
       y
   | 0  1
---------
  0| a  c
x  |
  1| b  d
.end_lisp

If 3boole* has more than three arguments, it is associated left
to right; thus,
.lisp
(boole fn x y z) = (boole fn (boole fn x y) z)
.end_lisp
With two arguments, the result of 3boole* is simply its second argument.
At least two arguments are required.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(boole 1 x y) = (logand x y)
(boole 6 x y) = (logxor x y)
(boole 2 x y) = (logand (lognot x) y)
.end_lisp

3logand*, 3logior*, and so on are usually preferred over the equivalent
forms of 3boole*.  3boole* is useful when the operation to be performed
is not constant.
.end_defun

.defconst boole-ior
.defconst1 boole-and
.defconst1 boole-xor
.defconst1 boole-eqv
.defconst1 boole-nand
.defconst1 boole-nor
.defconst1 boole-orc1
.defconst1 boole-orc2
.defconst1 boole-andc1
.defconst1 boole-andc2
The 3boole* opcodes that correspond to the functions 3logior*, 3logand*, etc.
.end_defconst

.defconst boole-clr
.defconst1 boole-set
.defconst1 boole-1
.defconst1 boole-2
The 3boole* opcodes for the four trivial operations.  Respectively, they
are those which always return zero, always return one, always return the
first argument, and always return the second argument.
.end_defconst

.defun bit-test x y
.defun1 logtest x y
3bit-test* is a predicate which returns 3t* if any of
the bits designated by the 1's in 2x* are 1's in 2y*.
3bit-test* is implemented as a macro which expands as follows:
.lisp
(bit-test 2x* 2y*) ==> (not (zerop (logand 2x* 2y*)))
.end_lisp
3logtest* is the Common Lisp name for this function.
.end_defun

.defun lsh x y
Returns 2x* shifted left 2y* bits if 2y* is positive or zero,
or 2x* shifted right 3|2y*|* bits if 2y* is negative.
Zero bits are shifted in (at either end) to fill unused positions.
2x* and 2y* must be fixnums.  (In some applications you may
find 3ash* useful for shifting bignums; see below.)
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(lsh 4 1) => #o10
(lsh #o14 -2) => 3
(lsh -1 1) => -2
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun ash x y
Shifts 2x* arithmetically left 2y* bits if 2y* is positive,
or right 2-y* bits if 2y* is negative.
Unused positions are filled by zeroes from the right, and
by copies of the sign bit from the left.  Thus, unlike 3lsh*,
the sign of the result is always the same as the sign of 2x*.
If 2x* is a fixnum or a bignum, this is a shifting operation.
If 2x* is a float, this does scaling (multiplication by a power of two),
rather than actually shifting any bits.
.end_defun

.defun rot x y
Returns 2x* rotated left 2y* bits if 2y* is positive or zero,
or 2x* rotated right 3|2y*|* bits if 2y* is negative.
The rotation considers 2x* as a 25-bit number (unlike Maclisp,
which considers 2x* to be a 36-bit number in both the pdp-10
and Multics implementations).
2x* and 2y* must be fixnums.  (There is no function for
rotating bignums.)
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(rot 1 2) => 4
(rot 1 -2) => #o20000000
(rot -1 7) => -1
(rot #o15 25.) => #o15
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun logcount integer
Returns the number of 1 bits in 2integer*, if it is positive.
Returns the number of 0 bits in 2integer*, if it is negative.
(There are infinitely many 1 bits in a negative integer.)
.lisp
(logcount #o15)  =>  3
(logcount #o-15)  =>  2
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun integer-length integer
The minimum number of bits (aside from sign) needed to represent
2integer* in two's complement.  This is the same as 3haulong*
for positive numbers.
.lisp
(integer-length 0) => 0
(integer-length 7) => 3
(integer-length 8) => 4
(integer-length -7) => 3
(integer-length -8) => 3
(integer-length -9) => 4
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun haulong integer
The same as 3integer-length* of the absolute value of 3integer*.
This name exists for Maclisp compatibility only.
.end_defun

.defun haipart x n
Returns the high 2n* bits of the binary representation of 3|2x*|*,
or the low 3-2n** bits if 2n* is negative.
2x* may be a fixnum or a bignum; its sign is ignored.
3haipart* could have been defined by:
.lisp
(defun haipart (x n)
  (setq x (abs x))
  (if (minusp n)
      (logand x (1- (ash 1 (- n))))
      (ash x (min (- n (haulong x))
		  0))))
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.section Byte Manipulation Functions
.setq byte-manipulation-functions section-page
.cindex byte
Several functions are provided for dealing with an arbitrary-width field of
contiguous bits appearing anywhere in an integer (a fixnum or a bignum).
Such a contiguous set of bits is called a 2byte*.  Note that
we are not using the term 2byte* to mean eight bits, but rather
any number of bits within a number.
These functions use numbers called 2byte specifiers* to
.cindex byte specifiers
designate a specific byte position within any word.  A byte specifier
contains two pieces of information: the size of the byte, and the
position of the byte.  The position is expressed as the number of least
significant bits which are not included in the byte.  A position of zero
means that the byte is at the right (least significant) end of the
number.

The maximum value of the size is 24, since a byte must fit in a fixnum
although bytes can be loaded from and deposited into bignums.  (Bytes
are always positive numbers.)

Byte specifiers are represented as fixnums whose two lowest octal digits
represent the 2size* of the byte, and whose higher (usually two, but
sometimes more) octal digits represent the 2position* of the byte
within a number.  For example, the byte-specifier #o0010 (i.e. 10
octal) refers to the lowest eight bits of a word, and the byte-specifier
#o1010 refers to the next eight bits.  The format of byte-specifiers is
taken from the pdp-10 byte instructions.

Much old code contains byte specifiers written explicitly as octal numbers.
It is cleaner to construct byte specifiers using 3byte* instead.
Decomposition of byte specifiers should always be done with
3byte-position* and 3byte-size*, as at some time in the future
other kinds of byte specifiers may be created to refer to fields
whose size is greater than #o77.

.defun byte size position
Returns a byte specifier for the byte of 2size* bits, positioned to
exclude the 2position* least significant bits.  This byte specifier
can be passed as the first argument to 3ldb*, 3dpb*, 3%logldb*,
3%logdpb*, 3mask-field*, 3%p-ldb*, 3%p-ldb-offset*, and so on.
.end_defun

.defun byte-position byte-spec
.defun1 byte-size byte-spec
Return, respectively, the size and the position of 2byte-spec*.
It is always true that
.lisp
(byte (byte-size 2byte-spec*) (byte-position 2byte-spec*))
.end_lisp
equals 2byte-spec*.
.end_defun

.defun ldb byte-spec integer 
Extracts a byte from 2integer* according to 2byte-soec*.  The
contents of this byte are returned right-justified in a fixnum.  The
name of the function, 3ldb*, means `load byte'.  2integer* may be a
fixnum or a bignum.  The returned value is always a fixnum.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(ldb (byte 6 3) #o4567) => #o56
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun load-byte integer position size
This is like 3ldb* except that instead of using a byte specifier,
the 2position* and 2size* are passed as separate arguments.
The argument order is not analogous to that of 3ldb* so that
3load-byte* can be compatible with Maclisp.
.end_defun

.defun ldb-test byte-spec integer
3ldb-test* is a predicate which returns 3t* if any of
the bits designated by the byte specifier 2byte-spec* are 1's in 2integer*.
That is, it returns 3t* if the designated field is non-zero.
3ldb-test* is implemented as a macro which expands as follows:
.lisp
(ldb-test 2byte-spec* 2integer*) ==> (not (zerop (ldb 2byte-spec* 2integer*)))
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun logbitp index integer
3t* if the bit 2index* up from the least significant in 2integer* is a 1.
This is equivalent to 3(ldb-test (byte 2index* 1) 2integer*)*.
.end_defun

.defun mask-field byte-spec fixnum
This is similar to 3ldb*; however, the specified byte of 2fixnum* is
positioned in the same byte of the returned value.  The returned value
is zero outside of that byte.  2fixnum* must be a fixnum.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(mask-field (byte 6 3) #o4567) => #o560
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun dpb byte byte-spec integer
Returns a number which is the same as 2integer* except in the bits
specified by 2byte-spec*.  The low bits of 2byte*, appropriately
many, are placed in those bits.  2byte* is interpreted as being
right-justified, as if it were the result of 3ldb*.  2integer* may
be a fixnum or a bignum.  The name means `deposit byte'.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(dpb #o23 (byte 6 3) #o4567) => #o4237
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun deposit-byte integer position size byte
This is like 3dpb* except that instead of using a byte specifier,
the 2position* and 2size* are passed as separate arguments.
The argument order is not analogous to that of 3dpb* so that
3deposit-byte* can be compatible with Maclisp.
.end_defun

.defun deposit-field byte byte-spec fixnum
This is like 3dpb*, except that 2byte* is not taken to
be left-justified; the 2byte-spec* bits of 2byte* are used
for the 2byte-spec* bits of the result, with the rest of the
bits taken from 2fixnum*.  2fixnum* must be a fixnum.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(deposit-field #o230 (byte 6 3) #o4567) => #o4237
.end_lisp
.end_defun

The behavior of the following two functions depends on the size of
fixnums, and so functions using them may not work the same way
on future implementations of Zetalisp.  Their names start
with 3%* because they are more like machine-level subprimitives
than the previous functions.

.defun %logldb byte-spec fixnum
3%logldb* is like 3ldb* except that it only loads out of fixnums and
allows a byte size of 25, i.e. all 25 bits of the fixnum
including the sign bit.
.end_defun

.defun %logdpb byte byte-spec fixnum
3%logdpb* is like 3dpb* except that it only deposits into fixnums.
Using this to change the sign-bit leaves the result as a fixnum,
while 3dpb* would produce a bignum result for arithmetic correctness.
3%logdpb* is good for manipulating fixnum bit-masks such as are used
in some internal system tables and data-structures.
.end_defun

.section Random Numbers

The functions in this section provide a pseudo-random number generator
facility.  The basic function you use is 3random*, which returns a new
pseudo-random number each time it is called.

.defun random &optional number random-state
Returns a randomly generated number.  If 2number* is specified, the
random number is of the same type as 2number* (floating if 2number*
is floating, etc.), nonnegative, and less than 2number*.

If 2number* is omitted, the result is a randomly chosen fixnum,
with all fixnums being equally likely.

If 2random-state* is present, it is used and updated in generating
the random number.  Otherwise, the default random-state (the value of
3*random-state**) is used (and is created if it doesn't already
exist).  The algorithm is executed inside a 3without-interrupts*
(see (without-interrupts-fun)) so two processes can use the same
random-state without colliding.
.end_defun

.defun si:random-in-range low high
Returns a random float in the interval [2low*, 2high*).
The default random-state is used.
.end_defun

A 2random-state* is a named structure of type 3random-state* whose
contents control the future actions of the random number generator.
Each time you call the function 3random*, it uses (and updates) one
random-state.  One random-state exists standardly and is used by
default.  To have several different controllable, resettable sources of
random numbers, you can create your own random-states.  Random-states
print as
.lisp
#s(random-state ...2more data*...)
.end_lisp
so that they can be read back in.

.defun random-state-p object
3t* if 2object* is a random-state.
.end_defun

.defvar *random-state*
This random-state is used by default when 3random* is called
and the random-state is not explicitly specified.
.end_defvar

.defun make-random-state &optional random-state
Creates and returns a new random-state object.
If 2random-state* is 3nil*, the new random-state is a copy of 3*random-state**.
If 2random-state* is a random-state, the new one is a copy of that one.
If 2random-state* is 3t*, the new random-state is initialized truly randomly
(based on the value of 3(time)*).
.end_defun

A random-state actually consists of an array of numbers and two pointers
into the array.  The pointers circulate around the array; each time a
random number is requested, both pointers are advanced by one, wrapping
around at the end of the array.  Thus, the distance forward from the
first pointer to the second pointer stays the same, allowing for
wraparound.  Let the length of the array be 2length* and the distance
between the pointers be 2offset*.  To generate a new random number,
each pointer is set to its old value plus one, modulo 2length*.  Then
the two elements of the array addressed by the pointers are added
together; the sum is stored back into the array at the location where
the second pointer points, and is returned as the random number after
being normalized into the right range.

This algorithm produces well-distributed random numbers if 2length*
and 2offset* are chosen carefully, so that the polynomial
2x* 3^* 2length* + 2x* 3^* 2offset* + 1 is irreducible over the mod-2 integers.  The
system uses 71. and 35.

The contents of the array of numbers should be initialized to anything
moderately random, to make the algorithm work.  The contents get
initialized by a simple random number generator, based on a
number called the 2seed*.  The initial value of the seed is set when
the random-state is created, and it can be changed.

.defun si:random-create-array length offset seed &optional (area 3nil*)
Creates and returns a new random-state according to precise
specifications.  2length* is the length of the array.  2offset* is
the distance between the pointers and should be an integer less than
2length*.  2seed* is the initial value of the seed, and should be a
fixnum.  This calls 3si:random-initialize* on the random state before
returning it.
.end_defun

.defun si:random-initialize random-state &optional new-seed
2random-state* must be a random-state, such as is created by
3si:random-create-array*.  If 2new-seed* is provided, it should be a
fixnum, and the seed is set to it.  3si:random-initialize* reinitializes the
contents of the array from the seed (calling 3random* changes the
contents of the array and the pointers, but not the seed).
.end_defun

.section Information on Numeric Precision

Common Lisp defines some constants whose values give information
in a standard way about the ranges of numbers representable in the
individual Lisp implementation.

.defconst most-negative-fixnum
Any integer smaller than this must be a bignum.
.end_defconst

.defconst most-positive-fixnum
Any integer larger than this must be a bignum.
.end_defconst

.defconst most-positive-short-float
No short float can be greater than this number.
.end_defconst

.defconst least-positive-short-float
No positive short float can be closer to zero than this number.
.end_defconst

.defconst least-negative-short-float
No negative short float can be closer to zero than this number.
.end_defconst

.defconst most-negative-short-float
No short float can be less than this (negative) number.
.end_defconst

.defconst most-positive-single-float
.defconst1 least-positive-single-float
.defconst1 least-negative-single-float
.defconst1 most-negative-single-float
Similar to the above, but for full-size floats rather than
for short floats.
.end_defconst

.defconst most-positive-double-float
.defconst1 least-positive-double-float
.defconst1 least-negative-double-float
.defconst1 most-negative-double-float
.defconst1 most-positive-long-float
.defconst1 least-positive-long-float
.defconst1 least-negative-long-float
.defconst1 most-negative-long-float
These are defined by Common Lisp to be similar to the above,
but for double-floats and long-floats.  On the Lisp Machine,
there are no distinct double and long floating formats; they are
synonyms for single-floats.  So these constants exist but their values
are the same as those of 3most-positive-single-float* and so on.
.end_defconst

.defconst short-float-epsilon
Smallest positive short float which can be added to 1.0s0 and make a difference.
That is, for any short float 2x* less than this, 3(+ 1.0s0 2x*)*
equals 1.0s0.
.end_defconst

.defconst single-float-epsilon
.defconst1 double-float-epsilon
.defconst1 long-float-epsilon
Smallest positive float which can be added to 1.0 and make a difference.
The three names are synonyms on the Lisp Machine,
for reasons explained above.
.end_defconst

.defconst short-float-negative-epsilon
Smallest positive short float which can be subtracted from 1.0s0
and make a difference.
.end_defconst

.defconst single-float-negative-epsilon
.defconst1 double-float-negative-epsilon
.defconst1 long-float-negative-epsilon
Smallest positive float which can be subtracted from 1.0 and make a difference.
.end_defconst

.section Arithmetic Ignoring Overflow

Sometimes it is desirable to have a form of arithmetic which has no
overflow checking (that would produce bignums),
and truncates results to the word size of the machine.

.defun %pointer-plus pointer-1 pointer-2
Returns a fixnum which is 2pointer-1* plus 2pointer-2*, modulo
what could be stored in the size of the pointer field (currently 25
bits).  Arguments other than fixnums are rarely useful, but no type
checks are made.
.end_defun

.defun %pointer-difference pointer-1 pointer-2
Returns a fixnum which is 2pointer-1* minus 2pointer-2*.
If the arguments are fixnums, rather than true pointers,
this provides subtraction modulo what can be stored in the
pointer field.
.end_defun

.defun %pointer-times pointer-1 pointer-2
Returns a fixnum which is 2pointer-1* times 2pointer-2*.  Arguments
other than fixnums are rarely useful, but no type checks are made.  The
two pointer fields are regarded as signed numbers.
.end_defun

.section 24-Bit Arithmetic

Sometimes it is useful to have a form of truncating arithmetic
with a strictly specified field width which is independent of
the range of fixnums permissible on a particular machine.
In Zetalisp, this is provided by the following set of functions.
Their answers are correct only modulo 2^24.

These functions should 2not* be used for efficiency; they are
probably less efficient than the functions which 2do* check for
overflow.  They are intended for algorithms which require this sort of
arithmetic, such as hash functions and pseudo-random number generation.

.defun %24-bit-plus x y
Returns the sum of 2x* and 2y* modulo 2^24.  Both arguments must
be fixnums.
.end_defun

.defun %24-bit-difference x y
Returns the difference of 2x* and 2y* modulo 2^24.  Both arguments must
be fixnums.
.end_defun

.defun %24-bit-times x y
Returns the product of 2x* and 2y* modulo 2^24.  Both arguments must
be fixnums.
.end_defun

.section Double-Precision Arithmetic

These peculiar functions are useful in programs that don't want to use
bignums for one reason or another.  They should usually be avoided,
as they are difficult to use and understand, and they depend on special
numbers of bits and on the use of twos-complement notation.

A double-precision number has 50 bits, of which one is the sign bit.  It
is represented as two fixnums.  The less signficant fixnum conveys 25
signficant bits and is regarded as unsigned (that is, what is normally
the sign bit is treated as an ordinary data bit); the more significant
fixnum has the same sign as the double-precision number.  Only
3%float-double* handles negative double-precision numbers; for the
other functions, the more signficant fixnum is always positive and
contains only 24 bits of actual data.

.defun %multiply-fractions num1 num2
Returns bits 25 through 48 (the most significant half) of the product of
2num1* and 2num2*, regarded as unsigned integers.  If you call this
and 3%pointer-times* on the same arguments 2num1* and 2num2*, you
can combine the results into a double-precision product.  If 2num1*
and 2num2* are regarded as two's-complement fractions, -1 3
2num** < 1, 3%multiply-fractions* returns 1/2 of their correct
product as a fraction.

[The name of this function isn't too great.]
.end_defun

.defun %divide-double dividend[25:48] dividend[0:24] divisor
Divides the double-precision number given by the first two
arguments by the third argument, and returns the single-precision
quotient.  Causes an error if 2divisor* is zero or if the quotient won't
fit in single precision.

There are only 24 bits in each half of the number, as neither sign
bit is used to convey information.
.end_defun

.defun %remainder-double dividend[25:48] dividend[0:24] divisor
Divides the double-precision number given by the first two
arguments by the third argument, and returns the
remainder.  Causes an error if 2divisor* is zero.
.end_defun

.defun %float-double high25 low25
2high25* and 2low25*, which must be fixnums, are concatenated
to produce a 50-bit unsigned positive integer.  A full-size float containing the
same value is constructed and returned.  Note that only the 31 most significant
bits are retained (after removal of leading zeroes.)  This function is
mainly for the benefit of 3read*.
.end_defun
