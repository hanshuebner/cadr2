.cindex evaluation
.setq description-of-evaluation page

	The following is a complete description of the actions taken by the
evaluator, given a 2form* to evaluate.

	If 2form* is a number, the result is 2form*.

	If 2form* is a string, the result is 2form*.

	If 2form* is a self-evaluating symbol (3nil*, 3t* or a keyword
such as 3:foo*), then 2form* itself is the result.

	If 2form* is any other symbol, the result is the value of 2form*,
considered as a variable.  If 2form*'s value is void, an error is
signaled.  The way symbols are bound to values is explained in
(variable-section) below.

	If 2form* is not any of the above types, and is not a list,
2form* itself is the result.

	In all remaining cases, 2form* is a list.  The evaluator
examines the car of the list to figure out what to do next.  There are
three possibilities: this form may be a 2special form*, a 2macro
form*, or a plain old 2function form*.  If the car is an explicit
function such as a list starting with 3lambda*, the form is a function
form.  If it is a symbol, things depend on the symbol's function
definition, which may be a special form definition (see
(special-function)), a macro definition, or an ordinary function.

	If 2form* is a special form, then it is handled accordingly;
each special form works differently.  All of them are documented in this
manual.  The internal workings of special forms are explained in more
detail on (special-function), but this hardly ever affects you.

	If 2form* is a macro form, then the macro is expanded as
explained in chapter (macros-chapter).

	If 2form* is a function form, it calls for the 2application*
of a function to 2arguments*.  The car of 2form* is a function or
the name of a function.  The cdr of 2form* is a list of subforms.  The
subforms are evaluated, sequentially, and each produces one argument for
the function.  The function is then applied to those arguments.
Whatever results the function returns are the values of the original
2form*.

	There is a lot more to be said about evaluation.  The way variables
work and the ways in which they are manipulated, including the binding of
arguments, is explained in (variable-section).  A basic explanation of
functions is in (function-section).  The way functions can return more
than one value is explained in (multiple-value).  The description of all
of the kinds of functions, and the means by which they are manipulated, is
in chapter (function-chapter).  Macros are explained in chapter
(macros-chapter).  The 3evalhook* facility, which lets you do something
arbitrary whenever the evaluator is invoked, is explained in
(evalhook-section).  Special forms are described all over the manual; each
special form is in the section on the facility it is part of.


.section Variables
.setq variable-section section-page

In Zetalisp, variables are implemented using symbols.  Symbols
are used for many things in the language, such as naming functions,
naming special forms, and being keywords; they are also useful to
programs written in Lisp, as parts of data structures.  But when
a symbol is evaluated, its value as a variable is taken.

.subsection Variables and Bindings

There are two different ways of changing the value of a variable.  One
is to 2set* the variable.  Setting a variable changes its value to a
new Lisp object, and the previous value of the variable is forgotten.
Setting of variables is usually done with the 3setq* special form.

.cindex binding
.cindex shadowing of bindings
The other way to change the value of a variable is with 2binding*
(also called 2lambda-binding*).  We say that a variable is 2bound*
(past participle of active verb) by the action of binding; we also say
that the variable is 2bound* (state of being) after a binding has been
made.  When a binding is made, the variable's old binding and value are
hidden or 2shadowed* by a new binding, which holds a new value.
Setting a variable places a new value into the current binding; it does
not change which binding is current.  In addition, shadowed bindings' values
are not affected by setting the variable.  Binding a variable does not affect
the value in the old current binding but that binding ceases to be
current so the value no longer applies.

.cindex unbinding
The action of binding is always followed eventually by the action of
unbinding.  This discards the current binding of the variable, with its
value.  The previous binding becomes current again, and the value in
it--unchanged since the newer binding was made, in normal operation--is
visible again.

.cindex scope of binding
Binding is normally done on entry to a function and by certain special forms
(3let*, 3do*, 3prog* and others).  The bindings are unbound
on exit from the function or the special form, even nonlocal exit such
as 3go*, 3return* or 3throw*.  The function or special form
is said to be the 2scope* of the bindings made therein.

Here is a simple example of making a binding, shadowing it,
unshadowing it, examining it, and unbinding it.  The inner, shadowing binding
is made, examined, set, examined and unbound.
.lisp
(let ((a 5))
  (print a)         1;prints 35**
  (let ((a "foo"))
    (print a)       1;prints 3"foo"**
    (setq a "bar")
    (print a))      1;prints 3"bar"**
  (print a))        1;prints 35**
.end_lisp

.cindex global binding
Every symbol has one binding which was never made and is never unbound.
This is the 2global* binding.  This binding is current whenever
no other binding has been established that would shadow it.
If you type 3(setq x 5)* in the Lisp listen loop, you set
the global binding of 3x*.  Programs often set global bindings
permanently using 3defvar* or one of its cousins ((defvar-fun)).
3setq-globally* and related functions can be used to set or
refer to the global binding even when it is shadowed ((setq-globally-fun)).

.lisp
(defvar a 5)   ;1sets the global binding*

(let ((a t))
  (print a))   ;1prints 3t**

a => 5         ;1the global binding is visible again*
.end_lisp

.cindex void binding
A binding does not need to have an actual value.  It can be 2void*
instead.  The variable is also called void.  Actually, a void binding
contains a weird internal value, which the system interprets as meaning
``there is no value here''.  (This is the data type code 3dtp-null*,
(dtp-null-var)).  Reference to a variable whose current binding is void
signals an error.  In fact, nearly all variables' global bindings are
void; only those that you or the system have set are not void.
3variable-makunbound* makes the current binding of a variable void
again ((variable-makunbound-fun)).

.cindex unbound variable
`Void' used to be called `unbound', and most function names, error
messages and documentation still use the term `unbound'.  The variable
is also called `unbound'.  The term `void' is being adopted because it is
less ambiguous.  `Unbound' can mean `void', or `not bound' (no binding
established), or the past participle of `unbind'.

.cindex lexical scope
.cindex dynamic scope
All bindings except global binding have a limited scope: one function
or special form.  This does not fully specify the scope, however:
it may be 2lexical* or 2dynamic*.  When a binding has lexical scope,
it is visible only from code written within the function or special
form that established it.  Subroutines called from within the scope,
but which are written elsewhere, never see the lexical binding.
By contrast, a dynamic binding is visible the whole time it exists
(except when it is shadowed, of course), which includes time spent
in subroutines called from within the binding construct.
The global binding of a symbol can be regarded as a dynamic binding that
lasts from the beginning of the session to the end of the session.

.cindex special variable
Lexical and dynamic bindings are made by the same kinds of function
definitions and special forms.  By default, the bindings are lexical.
You request a dynamic binding instead using a 2special-declaration* at
the beginning of the body of the function definition or special form.
Also, some symbols are marked 2globally special*; every binding of
such a symbol is dynamic.  This is what 3defvar*, etc., do to a
symbol.  Dynamic bindings are also called 2special bindings*, and the
variable bound is called a 2special variable*.  Each use of a symbol
as a variable (this includes setting as well as examining) is also
marked as lexical or dynamic by the same declarations.  A dynamic use
sees only dynamic bindings, and a lexical use sees only lexical
bindings.

In the examples above it makes no difference whether the bindings of
3a* are lexical or dynamic, because all the code executed between the
binding and unbinding is also written lexically within the 3let*
which made the binding.  Here is an example where it makes a difference:

.lisp
(defun foo ()
  (print a))

(let ((a 5))
  (foo))

>>Error: the variable A is used free but not special.
.end_lisp

If the intention is that 5 be printed, a dynamic binding is required.
A dynamic binding would remain visible for all the execution from the
entry to the 3let* to the exit from the 3let*, including the execution
of the definition of 3foo*.  Actually, the default is to do lexical binding.
Since the binding of 3a* is lexical, it is visible only for the evaluation
of expressions written inside the 3let*, which does not include the body
of 3foo*.  In fact, an error happens when 3foo* evaluates 3a*,
since 3a* there is supposed to be lexical and no lexical binding is
visible.  If you compile 3foo*, you get a compiler warning about 3a*.

.cindex free variable
The use of 3a* inside 3foo*, not lexically within any binding of 3a*,
is called 2free*, and 3a* is called a 2free variable* of 3foo*.
Free variables are erroneous unless they are special.  Strictly speaking,
it is erroneous to type 3(setq x 5)* at top level in the Lisp listener
if 3x* has not been made globally special, but this is permitted
as an exception because it is so often useful.

One way to make the example work is to make 3a* globally special:

.lisp
(defvar a)

(defun foo () (print a))

(let ((a 5))
  (foo))
.end_lisp

.nopara
prints 5.  The global specialness of 3a* tells 3let* to make a dynamic
binding and tells the evaluation of 3a* in 3foo* to look for one.

Another way is with declarations at the point of binding and the point of use:

.lisp
(defun foo ()
  (declare (special a))
  (print a))

(let ((a 5))
  (declare (special a))
  (foo))
.end_lisp

A declaration at the point of binding affects only that binding, not
other bindings made within it to shadow it.  Another way of stating this
is that a binding is affected only by a declaration in the construct
that makes the binding, not by declarations in surrounding constructs.
Thus,
.lisp
(let ((a 5))             ;1this binding is dynamic*
  (declare (special a))
  (let ((a "foo"))       ;1this binding is lexical*
    2no declaration here*
    ... a ...            ;1this reference is lexical since*
    ...                  ;1 the innermost binding is lexical*
    (let ()
      (declare (special a))
      ... a ...          ;1this reference is dynamic, and sees value 35**
    ...))
.end_lisp

[Currently, for historical compatibility, bindings 2are* affected
by surrounding declarations.  However, whenever this makes a difference,
the compiler prints a warning to inform the programmer that the declaration
should be moved.]

The classical case where dynamic binding is useful is for
parameter variables like 3*read-base**:
.lisp
(let ((*read-base* 16.))
  (read))
.end_lisp
reads an expression using hexadecimal numbers by default.
3*read-base** is globally special, and the subroutine of 3read*
that reads integers uses 3*read-base** free.

Here is an example where lexical bindings are desirable:

.lisp
(let ((a nil))
  (mapatoms (function (lambda (symbol) (push symbol a))))
  a)
.end_lisp

Because the reference to 3a* from within the internal function
is lexical, the only binding it can see is the one made by this 3let*.
3mapatoms* cannot interfere by binding 3a* itself.
Consider: if 3mapatoms* makes a lexical binding of 3a*,
it is not visible here because this code is not written inside
the definition of 3mapatoms*.  If 3mapatoms* makes a dynamic binding
of 3a*, it is not visible here because the reference to 3a*
is not declared special and therefore sees only lexical bindings.

.cindex lexical closure
The fact that 3function* is used to mark the internal function
is crucial.  It causes the lexical environment appropriate for
the function to be combined with the code for the function
in a 2lexical closure*, which is passed to 3mapatoms*.

The last example shows 2downward* use of lexical closures.
2Upward* use is also possible, in which a function is closed
inside a lexical environment and then preserved after the
binding construct has been exited.

.lisp
(defun mycons (a d)
  (function (lambda (x)
	      (cond ((eq x 'car) a)
		    ((eq x 'cdr) d)))))

(defun mycar (x) (funcall x 'car))
(defun mycdr (x) (funcall x 'cdr))

(setq mc (mycons 4 t))

(mycar mc)  =>  4
(mycdr mc)  =>  t
.end_lisp

3mycons* returns an object that can be called as a function
with one argument.  This object retains a pointer to a lexical
environment that has a binding for 3a* and a binding for 3d*.
The function 3mycons* that made those bindings
has been exited, but this is irrelevant because the bindings were
not dynamic.  Since the code of the lambda-expression is lexically
within the body of 3mycons*, that function can see the lexical bindings
made by 3mycons* no matter when it is called.
The function returned by 3mycons* records two values and
can deliver either of them when asked, and is therefore analogous
to a cons cell.

Only lexical bindings are transferred automatically downward and upward,
but dynamic bindings can be used in the same ways if explicitly requested
through the use of the function 3closure*.  See (closure) for more
information.

.cindex value cell
.cindex special pdl
Dynamic bindings, including the global binding, are stored (unless
shadowed) in a particular place: the symbol's 2value cell*.
This is a word at a fixed offset in the symbol itself.  When a new
dynamic binding is made, the value in the value cell is saved away
on a stack called the 2special pdl*.  The new binding's value
is placed in the value cell.  When the new binding is unbound, the
old binding's value is copied off of the special pdl, into the
value cell again.  The function 3symeval* examines the
value cell of a symbol chosen at run time; therefore, it sees
the current dynamic binding of the symbol.

Lexical bindings are never stored in the symbol's value cell.  The
compiler stores them in fixed slots in stack frames.  The interpreter
stores them in alists that live in the stack.  It should be noted that
if the lexical binding is made by compiled code, then all code that
ought to see the binding is necessarily also compiled; if the binding is
made by interpreted code, then all code that ought to see the binding
is necessarily interpreted.  Therefore, it is safe for the compiler and
interpreter to use completely different techniques for recording lexical
bindings.

Lexical binding is the default because the compiler can find with certainty
all the places where a lexical binding is used, and usually can use short cuts
based on this certainty.  For dynamic bindings slow but general code must always
be generated.

.subsection Setting Variables

Here are the constructs used for setting variables.

.defspec setq {variable value}...
The 3setq* special form is used to set the value of a variable or of
many variables.  The first 2value* is evaluated, and the first
2variable* is set to the result.  Then the second 2value* is
evaluated, the second 2variable* is set to the result, and so on for
all the variable/value pairs.  3setq* returns the last value, i.e.
the result of the evaluation of its last subform.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(setq x (+ 3 2 1) y (cons x nil))
.end_lisp
3x* is set to 36*, 3y* is set to 3(6)*, and the 3setq* form
returns 3(6)*.  Note that the first variable was set before
the second value form was evaluated, allowing that form to use the new value of 3x*.
.end_defspec

.defmac psetq {variable value}...
A 3psetq* form is just like a 3setq* form, except
that the variables are set ``in parallel''; first all of the 2value* forms
are evaluated, and then the 2variables* are set to the resulting
values.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(setq a 1)
(setq b 2)
(psetq a b b a)
a => 2
b => 1
.end_lisp
.end_defmac

.defspec variable-location symbol
Returns a locative to the cell in which the value of 2symbol* is
stored.  2symbol* is an unevaluated argument, so the name of the
symbol must appear explicitly in the code.

For a special variable, this is equivalent to
.lisp
(value-cell-location '2symbol*)
.end_lisp
For a lexical variable, the place where the value is stored is
a matter decided by the interpreter or the compiler, but in any case
3variable-location* nevertheless returns a pointer to it.

In addition, if 2symbol* is a special variable that is closed over,
the value returned is an external value cell, the same as the value of
3locate-in-closure* applied to the proper closure and 2symbol*.
This cell 2always* contains the closure binding's value, which is
2current* only inside the closure.  See (external-value-cell).
.end_defspec

.defspec variable-boundp symbol
3t* if variable 2symbol* is not void.
It is equivalent to 
.lisp
(location-boundp (variable-location 2symbol*))
.end_lisp
2symbol* is not evaluated.
.end_defspec

.defspec variable-makunbound symbol
Makes 2symbol*'s current binding void.  It is equivalent to
.lisp
(location-makunbound (variable-location 2symbol*))
.end_lisp
2symbol* is not evaluated.
.end_defspec

.subsection Variable Binding Constructs

Here are the constructs used for binding variables.

.defspec let ((var value)...) body...
Is used to bind some variables to some objects, and evaluate some forms
(the body) in the context of those bindings.
A 3let* form looks like
.lisp
(let ((2var1* 2vform1*)
      (2var2* 2vform2*)
      ...)
  2bform1*
  2bform2*
  ...)
.end_lisp
When this form is evaluated, first the 2vforms* (the values) are evaluated.
Then the 2vars* are bound to the values returned by the
corresponding 2vforms*.  Thus the bindings happen in parallel;
all the 2vforms* are evaluated before any of the 2vars* are bound.
Finally, the 2bforms* (the body) are evaluated sequentially, the old values
of the variables are restored, and the result of the last 2bform* is returned.

You may omit the 2vform* from a 3let* clause, in which case it is as
if the 2vform* were 3nil*: the variable is bound to 3nil*.
Furthermore, you may replace the entire clause (the list of the variable
and form) with just the variable, which also means that the variable
gets bound to 3nil*.  Example:
.lisp
(let ((a (+ 3 3))
      (b 'foo)
      (c)
      d)
  ...)
.end_lisp
Within the body, 3a* is bound to 36*, 3b* is bound to 3foo*, 3c* is
bound to 3nil*, and 3d* is bound to 3nil*.
.end_defspec

.defspec let* ((var value)...) body...
3let** is the same as 3let* except that the binding is sequential.  Each
2var* is bound to the value of its 2vform* before the next 2vform*
is evaluated.  This is useful when the computation of a 2vform* depends on
the value of a variable bound in an earlier 2vform*.  Example:
.lisp
(let* ((a (+ 1 2))
       (b (+ a a)))
 ...)
.end_lisp
Within the body, 3a* is bound to 33* and 3b* is bound to 36*.
.end_defspec

.defspec let-if condition ((var value)...) body...
3let-if* is a variant of 3let* in which the binding of variables is conditional.
The 3let-if* special form, typically written as
.lisp
(let-if 2cond*
	((2var-1* 2val-1*) (2var-2* 2val-2*)...)
  2body*...)
.end_lisp
first evaluates the predicate form 2cond*.  If the result is non-3nil*, the value forms
2val-1*, 2val-2*, etc. are evaluated and then the variables 2var-1*, 2var-2*,
etc. are bound to them.  If the result is 3nil*, the
2vars* and 2vals* are ignored.  Finally the body forms are evaluated.

The bindings are always dynamic, and it is the user's responsibility
to put in appropriate declarations so that the body forms consider
the variables dynamic.
.end_defspec

.defmac let-globally ((var value)...) body...
.defmac1 let-globally-if condition ((var value)...) body...
3let-globally* is similar in form to 3let* (see (let-fun)).  The
difference is that 3let-globally* does not 2bind* the variables;
instead, it saves the old values and 2sets* the variables, and sets up
an 3unwind-protect* (see (unwind-protect-fun)) to set them back.  The
important consequence is that, with
3let-globally*, when the current stack group (see (stack-group))
co-calls some other stack group, the old values of the variables are
2not* restored.  Thus 3let-globally* makes the new values visible in
all stack groups and processes that don't bind the variables themselves,
not just in the current stack group.  Therefore, 3let-globally*
can be used for communication between stack groups and between processes.

3let-globally-if* modifies and restores the variables only if the
value of 2condition* is non-3nil*.  The 2body* is executed in any case.

Since 3let-globally* is based on 3setq*, it makes sense for both
lexical and dynamic variables.  But its main application exists
only for dynamic variables.

The 3globally* in 3let-globally* does not mean the same thing
as the 3globally* in 3setq-globally* and related functions.
.end_defmac

.defspec progv symbol-list value-list body...
3progv* is a special form to provide the user with extra control
over binding.  It binds a list of variables dynamically to a list of values,
and then evaluates some forms.  The lists of variables and values
are computed quantities; this is what makes 3progv* different from
3let*, 3prog*, and 3do*.

3progv* first evaluates 2symbol-list* and 2value-list*, and then binds each
symbol to the corresponding value.  If too few values are supplied, the
remaining symbols' bindings are made empty.  If too many values are
supplied, the excess values are ignored.

After the symbols have been bound to the values, the 2body* forms are
evaluated, and finally the symbols' bindings are undone.
The result returned is the value of the last form in the body.
Assuming that the variables 3a*, 3b*, 3foo* and 3bar*
are globally special, we can do:

.lisp
(setq a 'foo b 'bar)

(progv (list a b 'b) (list b)
  (list a b foo bar))
    => (foo nil bar nil)
.end_lisp

.nopara
During the evaluation of the body of this 3progv*, 3foo*
is bound to 3bar*, 3bar* is bound to 3nil*, 3b* is
bound to 3nil*, and 3a* retains its top-level value 3foo*.
.end_defspec

.defspec progw vars-and-vals-form body...
3progw* is like 3progv* except that it has a different way of
deciding which variables to bind and what values to give them.  Like
3progv*, it always makes dynamic bindings.

First, 2vars-and-val-forms-form* is evaluated.  Its value should be a list
that looks like the first subform of a 3let*:
.lisp
  ((2var1* 2val-form-1*)
   (2var2* 2val-form-2*)
   ...)
.end_lisp
Each element of this list is processed in turn, by evaluating the
2val-form* and binding the 2var* dynamically to the resulting
value.  Finally, the 2body* forms are evaluated sequentially, the
bindings are undone, and the result of the last form is returned.  Note
that the bindings are sequential, not parallel.

This is a very unusual special form because of the way the evaluator is
called on the result of an evaluation.  3progw* is useful mainly for
implementing special forms and for functions part of whose contract is
that they call the interpreter.  For an example of the latter, see
3sys:*break-bindings** ((sys:*break-bindings*-var)); 3break*
implements this by using 3progw*.
.end_defspec

See also 3%bind* ((%bind-fun)), which is a
subprimitive that gives you maximal control over binding.

.subsection Defining Global Variables

Here are the constructs for defining global variables.
Each makes the variable globally special, provides a value,
records documentation, and allows the editor to find where
all this was done.

.defmac defvar variable [initial-value] [documentation]
3defvar* is the recommended way to declare the use of a global variable in a
program.  Placed at top level in a file,
.lisp
(defvar 2variable* 2initial-value* 
  "2documentation*")
.end_lisp
declares 2variable* globally special and records its location in the
file for the sake of the editor so that you can ask to see where the
variable is defined.  The documentation string is remembered and
returned if you do 3(documentation '2variable* 'variable)*.

If 2variable* is void, it is initialized to the result of evaluating
the form 2initial-value*.  2initial-value* is evaluated only if it
is to be used.

If you do not wish to give 2variable* any initial value, use the
symbol 3:unbound* as the 2initial-value* form.  This is treated
specially; no attempt is made to evaluate 3:unbound*.

Using a documentation string is better than using a comment to describe
the use of the variable, because the documentation string is accessible
to system programs that can show the documentation to you while you are
using the machine.  While it is still permissible to omit
2initial-value* and the documentation string, it is recommended that
you put a documentation string in every 3defvar*.

3defvar* should be used only at top level, never in function
definitions, and only for global variables (those used by more than one
function).  3(defvar foo 'bar)* is roughly equivalent to
.lisp
(declare (special foo))
(if (not (boundp 'foo))
    (setq foo 'bar))
.end_lisp

If 3defvar* is used in a patch file (see (patch-facility))
or is a single form (not a region) evaluated with the editor's
compile/evaluate from buffer commands,
if there is an initial-value the variable is always set to it
regardless of whether it is void.
.end_defmac

.defmac defconst variable initial-value [documentation]
.defmac1 defparameter variable initial-value [documentation]
3defconst* is the same as 3defvar* except that if an initial value
is given the variable is always set to it regardless of whether it is
already bound.  The rationale for this is that 3defvar* declares a
global variable, whose value is initialized to something but will then
be changed by the functions that use it to maintain some state.  On the
other hand, 3defconst* declares a constant, whose value will be
changed only by changes 2to* the program, never by the operation of
the program as written.  3defconst* always sets the variable to the
specified value so that if, while developing or debugging the program,
you change your mind about what the constant value should be, and then
you evaluate the 3defconst* form again, the variable gets the new
value.  It is 2not* the intent of 3defconst* to declare that the
value of 2variable* will never change; for example, 3defconst* is
2not* a license to the compiler to build assumptions about the value of
2variable* into programs being compiled.

As with 3defvar*, you should include a documentation string in every 3defconst*.
.end_defmac

.defmac defconstant symbol value [documentation]
Defines a true constant.  The compiler is permitted to assume
it will never change.  Therefore, if a function that refers
to 2symbol*'s value is compiled, the compiled function may
contain 2value* merged into it and may not actually refer
to 2symbol* at run time.

You should not change the value of 2symbol* except by
reexecuting the 3defconstant* with a new 2value*.  If you do this,
it is necessary to recompile any compiled functions that refer
to 2symbol*'s value.
.end_defmac

.subsection The Global Binding

This section describes functions which examine or set the global binding of a
variable even when it is shadowed and cannot be accessed simply by evaluating
the variable or setting it.

The primary use of these functions is for init files to set
variables which are bound by the 3load* function, such as 3package*
or 3base*.  3(setq package (find-package 'foo))* executed from a
file being loaded has no effect beyond the end of loading that file,
since it sets the binding of 3package* made by 3load*.  However, if
you use 3setq-globally* instead, the current binding in effect during
loading is actually not changed, but when the 3load* exits and the
global binding is in effect again, 3foo* will become the current package.

.defmac setq-globally {symbol value}...
Sets each 2symbol*'s global binding to the 2value* that follows.
The 2value*'s are evaluated but the 2symbol*'s are not.
.end_defmac

.defun set-globally symbol value
Sets the global binding of 2symbol* to 2value*.
.end_defun

.defun makunbound-globally symbol
Makes the global binding of 2symbol* be void.
.end_defun

.defun boundp-globally symbol
Returns 3t* if the global binding of 2symbol* is not void.
.end_defun

.defun symeval-globally symbol
.defun1 symbol-value-globally symbol
Return the value of the global binding of 2symbol*.
An error is signaled if the global binding is void.
.end_defun

See also 3pkg-goto-globally* ((pkg-goto-globally-fun)), a ``globally''
version of 3pkg-goto*.  Note that 3let-globally* is 2not* analogous
to these functions, as it modifies the current bindings of symbols rather
than their global bindings.  This is an unfortunate collision of naming
conventions.

.section Generalized Variables
.setq setf section-page
.cindex setf

In Lisp, a variable is something that can remember one piece of data.
The primary conceptual operations on a variable are to recover that
piece of data and to change it.  These might be called 2access* and
2update*.  The concept of variables named by symbols, explained above,
can be generalized to any storage location that can
remember one piece of data, no matter how that location is named.

For each kind of generalized variable, there are typically three
functions which implement the conceptual 2access*, 2update* and
2locate* operations.  For example, 3symeval* accesses a symbol's
value cell, 3set* updates it, and 3value-cell-location* returns the
value cell's location.  3array-leader* accesses the contents of an
array leader element, 3store-array-leader* updates it, and
3ap-leader* returns the location of the leader element.  3car*
accesses the car of a cons, 3rplaca* updates it, and 3car-location*
returns the location of the car.

Rather than thinking of this as two functions, which operate on a storage
location somehow deduced from their arguments, we can shift our point of
view and think of the access function as a 2name* for the storage
location.  Thus 3(symeval 'foo)* is a name for the value of 3foo*, and
3(aref a 105)* is a name for the 105th element of the array 3a*.
Rather than having to remember the update function associated with each
access function, we adopt a uniform way of updating storage locations named
in this way, using the 3setf* special form.  This is analogous to the
way we use the 3setq* special form to convert the name of a variable
(which is also a form which accesses it) into a form that updates it.
In fact, 3setf* is an upward compatible generalization of 3setq*.
Similarly, the location of the generalized variable can be obtained
using the 3locf* construct.

.subsection setf

3setf* is the construct for storing a new value into a generalized variable
which is identified by the form which would obtain the current value of the
variable.  For example,
.lisp
(setf (car x) y)
.end_lisp
stores the value of 3y* into the car of the value of 3x*.

3setf* is particularly useful in combination with structure-accessing
macros, such as those created with 3defstruct*, because the knowledge of the
representation of the structure is embedded inside the macro, and the programmer
shouldn't have to know what it is in order to alter an element of the structure.

3setf* is actually a macro which expands into the appropriate update
code.  It has a database, explained in (setf-extension), that
associates from access functions to update functions.

.defmac setf {place value}...
Takes a form called 2place* that 2accesses* something and ``inverts'' the form to produce a corresponding form to 2update* the thing.
A 3setf* expands into an update form, which stores the result of evaluating
the form 2value* into the place referenced by the 2place*.
If multiple 2place*`s and 2value*`s are specified,
each one specifies an update, and each update is done before
the following updates' arguments are computed.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(setf (array-leader foo 3) 'bar)
		==> (store-array-leader 'bar foo 3)
(setf a 3) ==> (setq a 3)
(setf (plist 'a) '(foo bar)) ==> (setplist 'a '(foo bar))
(setf (aref q 2) 56) ==> (sys:set-aref q 2 56)
(setf (cadr w) x) ==> (sys:setcdr (cdr w) x)
.end_lisp

The value of a 3setf* form is always the 2value* stored by
the last update it performs.  Thus, 3(setf (cadr w) x)*
is not really the same as 3(rplaca (cdr w) x)*, because
the 3setf* returns 3x* and the 3rplaca* returns
3w*.  In fact, the expansion of 3setf* of 3cdr* uses
an internal function 3si:setcdr* which exists specifically
for this purpose.

If 2place* invokes a macro or a substitutable function, then
3setf* expands the 2place* and starts over again.  This lets you
use 3setf* together with 3defstruct* accessor macros.
.end_defmac

.defcondition sys:unknown-setf-reference (3error*)
.defcondition1 sys:unknown-locf-reference (3error*)
These are signaled when 3setf* or 3locf* does not know how to expand
the 2place*.  The 3:form* operation on the condition instance
returns the 2access-form*.
.end_defcondition

.defmac psetf {place value}...
Stores each 2value* into the corresponding 2place*, with the changes taking
effect in parallel.  Thus,
.lisp
(psetf (car x) (cdr x) (cdr x) (car x))
.end_lisp
interchanges the car and cdr of 3x*.

The subforms of the 2place*s, and the 2values*, are evaluated
in order; thus, in 
.lisp
(psetf (aref a (tyi)) (tyi)
       (aref b (tyi)) (aref a (tyi)))
.end_lisp
the first input character indexes 3a*, the second is stored, the third
indexes 3b*, and the fourth indexes 3a*.  The parallel nature of
3psetf* implies that, should the first and fourth characters be equal,
the old value of that element of 3a* is what is stored into the array
3b*, rather than the new value which comes from the second character
read.
.end_defmac

.defmac shiftf place... 
Sets the first 2place* from the second, the second from the third, and
so on.  The last 2place* is not set, so it doesn't really need to be a
3setf*'able place; it can be any form.  The value of the 3shiftf*
form is the old value of the first 2place*.  Thus,
.lisp
(shiftf x (car (foo)) b)
.end_lisp
evaluates 3(foo)*, copies the car of that value into 3x*,
copies 3b* into the car of that value, then returns the
former value of 3x*.
.end_defmac

.defmac rotatef place...
Sets the first 2place* from the second, the second from the third, and
so on, and sets the last 2place* from the old value of the first
2place*.  Thus, the values of the 2place*'s are permuted among the
2place*'s in a cyclic fashion.

With only two 1place*'s, their values are exchanged:
.lisp
(rotatef (car x) (cdr x))
.end_lisp
is equivalent to the 3psetf* example above.
.end_defmac

.defmac swapf place1 place2
Exchanges the contents of 2place1* and 2place2*.
This is a special case of 3rotatef*.
.end_defmac

.defmac incf place [amount]
Increments the value of a generalized variable.  3(incf 2ref*)* increments
the value of 2ref* by 1.  3(incf 2ref* 2amount*)* adds 2amount*
to 2ref* and stores the sum back into 2ref*.
The 3incf* form returns the value after incrementation.

3incf* expands into a 3setf* form, so 2ref* can be anything that
3setf* understands as its 2place*.

3incf* is defined using 3define-modify-macro*, (define-modify-macro-fun).
.end_defmac

.defmac decf place [amount]
Decrements the value of a generalized variable.  Just like 3incf*
except that 2amount* (or 1) is subtracted rather than added.
.end_defmac

See also 3push* ((push-fun)), 3pop* ((pop-fun)), 3pushnew*
((pushnew-fun)), 3getf* ((getf-fun)) and 3remf* ((remf-fun)).

.subsection locf

Besides the 2access* and 2update* conceptual operations on
generalized variables, there is a third basic operation, which we might call
2locate*.  Given the name of a storage cell, the 2locate* operation
returns the address of that cell as a locative pointer (see
(locative)).  This locative pointer is a first-class Lisp data object
which is a kind of reference to the cell.  It can be passed as an
argument to a function which operates on any cell,
regardless of where the cell is found.  It can be used to 2bind* the contents
of the cell, just as special variables are bound,
using the 3%bind* subprimitive (see (%bind-fun)).

Of course, this can work only on generalized variables whose implementation is really to
store their value in a memory cell.  A generalized variable with an 2update*
operation that encrypts the value and an 2access* operation that decrypts
it could not have the 2locate* operation, since the value per se is not
actually stored anywhere.

.defmac locf place
3locf* takes a form that 2accesses* some cell, and produces
a corresponding form to create a locative pointer to that cell.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(locf (array-leader foo 3)) ==> (ap-leader foo 3)
(locf a) ==> (value-cell-location 'a)
(locf (plist 'a)) ==> (property-cell-location 'a)
(locf (aref q 2)) ==> (aloc q 2)
.end_lisp

If 2place* invokes a macro or a substitutable function, then
3locf* expands the 2place* and starts over again.  This lets you
use 3locf* together with 3defstruct* accessor macros.
.end_defmac

.section Functions
.setq function-section section-page
.setq lambda-list section-page
.cindex lambda list

In the description of evaluation on (description-of-evaluation), we
said that evaluation of a function form works by applying the function
to the results of evaluating the argument subforms.  What is a function,
and what does it mean to apply it?  In Zetalisp there are many
kinds of functions, and applying them may do many different kinds of
things.  For full details, see (function-functions).  Here we
explain the most basic kinds of functions and how they work.  In
particular, this section explains 2lambda lists* and all their
important features.

The simplest kind of user-defined function is the 2lambda-expression*,
which is a list that looks like:
.lisp
(lambda 2lambda-list* 2body1* 2body2*...)
.end_lisp
The first element of the lambda-expression is the symbol 3lambda*; the
second element is a list called the 2lambda list*, and the rest of the
elements are called the 2body*.  The lambda list, in its simplest
form, is just a list of variables.  Assuming that this simple form
is being used, here is what happens when a lambda expression is applied
to some arguments.  First, the number of arguments and the number of
variables in the lambda list must be the same, or else an error is signaled.
Each variable is bound to the corresponding argument value.  Then
the forms of the body are evaluated sequentially.  After this, the
bindings are all undone, and the value of the last form in the body is
returned.

This may sound something like the description of 3let*, above.  The
most important difference is that the lambda-expression is not a form at
all; if you try to evaluate a lambda-expression, you get an error because
3lambda* is not a defined function.  The lambda-expression is a
2function*, not a form.   A 3let* form gets evaluated, and the
values to which the variables are bound come from the evaluation of some
subforms inside the 3let* form; a lambda-expression gets applied, and
the values are the arguments to which it is applied.

.cindex parameters

The variables in the lambda list are sometimes called 2parameters*,
by analogy with other languages.  Some other terminologies would refer
to these as 2formal parameters*, and to arguments as 2actual parameters*.

Lambda lists can have more complex structure than simply being a list of
variables.  There are additional features accessible by using certain
keywords (which start with 3&*) and/or lists as elements of the
lambda list.

The principal weakness of simple lambda lists is that any
function written with one must only take a certain, fixed number of
arguments.  As we know, many very useful functions, such as 3list*,
3append*, 3+*, and so on, accept a varying number of arguments.
Maclisp solved this problem by the use of 2lexprs* and 2lsubrs*,
which were somewhat inelegant since the parameters had to be referred to
by numbers instead of names (e.g. 3(arg 3)*).  (For compatibility
reasons, Zetalisp supports 2lexpr*s, but they should not be
used in new programs.)  Simple lambda lists also require that
arguments be matched with parameters by their position in the
sequence.  This makes calls hard to read when there are a great many
arguments.  Keyword parameters enable the use of other, more readable styles of call.

.cindex "keyword parameters"
.cindex "positional parameters"
.cindex "optional parameters"
.cindex "required parameters"
.cindex "rest parameters"

	In general, a function in Zetalisp has zero or more
2positional* parameters, followed if desired by a single 2rest*
parameter, followed by zero or more 2keyword* parameters.  The
positional parameters may be 2required* or 2optional*,
but all the optional parameters must follow all the required ones.
The required/optional distinction does not apply to the rest
parameter; all keyword parameters are optional.

The caller must provide enough arguments so that each of the required
parameters gets bound, but he may provide extra arguments for some of
the optional parameters.  Also, if there is a rest parameter, he can
provide as many extra arguments as he wants, and the rest parameter
is bound to a list of all these extras.  Optional parameters may
have a 2default-form*, which is a form to be evaluated to produce
the default value for the parameter if no argument is supplied.

Positional parameters are matched with arguments by the position of
the arguments in the argument list.  Keyword parameters are matched
with their arguments by matching the keyword name; the arguments need
not appear in the same order as the parameters.  If an optional
positional argument is omitted, then no further arguments can be
present.  Keyword parameters allow the caller to decide independently
for each one whether to specify it.

Here is the exact algorithm used to
match up the arguments with the parameters:
.table 1 0 500 0 80
.item Required positional parameters:
The first required positional parameter is bound to the first
argument.  3apply* continues to bind successive required
positional parameters
to the successive arguments.  If, during this process, there are no
arguments left but there are still some required parameters which have
not been bound yet, it is an error (``too few arguments'').

.item Optional positional parameters:
After all required parameters are handled, 3apply* continues with the
optional positional parameters, if any.  It binds each successive
parameter to the next argument.  If, during this process, there are no
arguments left, each remaining optional parameter's default-form is
evaluated, and the parameter is bound to it.  This is done one parameter
at a time; that is, first one default-form is evaluated, and then the
parameter is bound to it, then the next default-form is evaluated, and
so on.  This allows the default for an argument to depend on the
previous argument.

.item After the positional parameters:
Now, if there are no remaining parameters (rest or keyword), and there are no
remaining arguments, we are finished.  If there are no more parameters
but there are still some arguments remaining, an error is signaled (``too
many arguments'').  If parameters remain, all the remaining arguments
are used for 2both* the rest parameter, if any, and the keyword
parameters.

.item Rest parameter:
If there is a rest parameter, it is bound to a list of all
the remaining arguments.  If there are no
remaining arguments, it is bound to 3nil*.

.item Keyword parameters:
If there are keyword parameters, the same remaining arguments are
used to bind them, as follows.
	The arguments for the keyword parameters are treated as a list
of alternating keyword symbols and associated values.  Each symbol is
matched with 3eq* against the allowed parameter keywords, which have
by default the same names as the parameters but in the 3keyword*
package.  (You can specify the keyword symbol explicitly in the lambda
list if you must; see below.)  Often the symbol arguments are constants
in the program, and it is convenient for this usage that keywords all
evaluate to themselves, but it is permissible for them to be computed by
expressions.
	If any keyword parameter has not received a value when all the
arguments have been processed, the default-form for the parameter is
evaluated and the parameter is bound to its value.  All keyword
parameters are optional.
.kindex :allow-other-keys "keyword arguments"
.setq allow-other-keys-kwd page
	There may be a keyword symbol among the arguments which does not
match any keyword parameter name.  By default this is an error, but the
lambda list can specify that there should be no error using
3&allow-other-keys*.  Also, if one of the keyword symbols among the
arguments is 3:allow-other-keys* and the value that follows it is
non-3nil* then there is no error.  When there is no error, for either
reason, the non-matching symbols and their associated values are simply
ignored.  The function can access these symbols and values through the
rest parameter, if there is one.  It is common for a function to check
only for certain keywords, and pass its rest parameter to another
function using 3apply*; that function will check for the keywords that
concern it.
.end_table

	The way you express which parameters are required, optional, rest and keyword
is by means of specially recognized symbols, which are called
3&-2keywords**, in the lambda list.  All such symbols' print names
begin with the character `3&*'.  A list of all such symbols is the value of
the symbol 3lambda-list-keywords*. 
.setq &rest page
.setq &key page
	The keywords used here are 3&key*, 3&optional* and 3&rest*.
The way they are used is best explained by means of examples;
the following are typical lambda lists, followed by descriptions
of which parameters are positional, rest or keyword; and required or optional.
.table 7
.item (a b c)
3a*, 3b*, and 3c* are all required and positional.  The function must be
passed three arguments.
.item (a b &optional c)
3a* and 3b* are required, 3c* is optional.  All three are
positional.  The function may be passed either two or three arguments.
.item (&optional a b c)
3a*, 3b*, and 3c* are all optional and positional.  The function may
be passed zero, one, two or three arguments.
.item (&rest a)
3a* is a rest parameter.  The function may be passed any number of arguments.
.item (a b &optional c d &rest e)
3a* and 3b* are required positional, 3c* and 3d* are optional
positional, and 3e* is rest.  The function may be passed two or more
arguments.
.item (&key a b)
3a* and 3b* are both keyword parameters.  A typical
call would look like
.lisp
(foo :b 69 :a '(some elements))
.exdent 96 or
(foo :a '(some elements) :b 69)
.exdent 96 or
(foo :a '(some elements))
.end_lisp
This illustrates that the parameters can be matched in either order, or omitted.
If a keyword is specified twice, the first value is used.
.item (x &optional y &rest z &key a b)
3x* is required positional, 3y* is optional positional,
3z* is rest, and 3a* and 3b* are keyword.
One or more arguments are allowed.  One or two arguments specify only
the positional parameters.  Arguments beyond the second specify both
the rest parameter and the keyword parameters, so that
.lisp
(foo 1 2 :b '(a list))
.end_lisp
specifies 31* for 3x*, 32* for 3y*, 3(:b (a
list))* for 3z*, and 3(a list)* for 3b*.  It does not
specify 3a*.
.item (&rest z &key a b c &allow-other-keys)
3z* is rest, and 3a*, 3b* and 3c* are keyword
parameters.  3&allow-other-keys* says that absolutely any keyword
symbols may appear among the arguments; these symbols and the values
that follow them have no effect on the keyword parameters, but do
become part of the value of 3z*.
.item (&rest z &key &allow-other-keys)
This is equivalent to 3(&rest z)*.  So, for that matter, is the
previous example, if the function does not use the values of 3a*,
3b* and 3c*.
.end_table

	In all of the cases above, the 2default-form* for each
optional parameter is 3nil*.  To specify your own default forms,
instead of putting a symbol as the element of a lambda list, put in a
list whose first element is the symbol (the parameter itself) and whose
second element is the default-form.  Only optional parameters may have
default forms; required parameters are never defaulted, and rest
parameters always default to 3nil*.  For example:
.table 7
.item (a &optional (b 3))
The default-form for 3b* is 33*.  3a* is a required parameter, and
so it doesn't have a default form.
.item (&optional (a 'foo) &rest d &key b (c (symeval a)))
3a*'s default-form is 3'foo*, 3b*'s is 3nil*, and 3c*'s is
3(symeval a)*.  Note that if
the function were called on no arguments,
3a* would be bound to the symbol 3foo*, and 3c* would be bound
to the value of the symbol 3foo*; this illustrates the fact
that each variable is bound immediately after its default-form is evaluated,
and so later default-forms may take advantage of earlier parameters
in the lambda list.  3b* and 3d* would be bound to 3nil*.
.end_table

.cindex supplied-p variable

	Occasionally it is important to know whether a certain optional
parameter was defaulted or not.  Just by looking at the value one cannot
distinguish between omitting it and passing the default value
explicitly as an argument.  The way to tell for sure is to put a third
element into the list: the third element should be a variable (a
symbol), and that variable is bound to 3nil* if the parameter was not
passed by the caller (and so was defaulted), or 3t* if the parameter
was passed.  The new variable is called a ``supplied-p'' variable; it is
bound to 3t* if the parameter is supplied.  For example:
.table 7
.item (a &optional (b 3 c))
The default-form for 3b* is 33*, and the supplied-p variable for 3b*
is 3c*.  If the function is called with one argument, 3b* is bound
to 33* and 3c* is bound to 3nil*.  If the function is called
with two arguments, 3b* is bound to the value that was passed
by the caller (which might be 33*), and 3c* is bound to 3t*.
.end_table

It is possible to specify a keyword parameter's symbol independently
of its parameter name.  To do this, use 2two* nested lists to
specify the parameter.  The outer list is the one which can contain
the default-form and supplied-p variable, if the parameter is
optional.  The first element of this list, instead of a symbol, is
again a list, whose elements are the keyword symbol and the parameter
variable name.
For example:
.table 7
.item (&key ((:a a)) ((:b b) t))
This is equivalent to 3(&key a (b t))*.
.item (&key ((:base base-value)))
This defines an argument which callers specify with the keyword
3:base*, but which within the function is referred to as the
variable 3base-value* so as to avoid binding the value of
3base*, which is a synonym for 3*print-base** and controls
how numbers are printed.
.end_table

	It is also possible to include, in the lambda list, some other
symbols, which are bound to the values of their default-forms upon
entry to the function.  These are 2not* parameters, and they are
never bound to arguments; they just get bound, as if they appeared
in a 3let** form.  (Whether you use aux-variables or bind the
variables with 3let** is a stylistic decision.)
	To include such symbols, put them after any parameters, preceeded
by the 3&*-keyword 3&aux*.  Examples:
.table 7
.item (a &optional b &rest c &aux d (e 5) (f (cons a e)))
3d*, 3e*, and 3f* are bound, when the function is
called, to 3nil*, 35*, and a cons of the first argument and 5.

You could, equivalently, use 3(a &optional b &rest c)* as
the lamda list and write 3(let* (d (e 5) (f (cons a e))) ...)*
around the body of the function.
.end_table

	It is important to realize that the list of arguments to which a
rest-parameter is bound is set up in whatever way is most efficiently
implemented, rather than in the way that is most convenient for the
function receiving the arguments.  It is not guaranteed to be a ``real''
list.  Sometimes the rest-args list is a stack list (see (stack-list))
stored in the function-calling stack, and loses its validity when the
function returns.  If a rest-argument is to be returned or made part of
permanent list-structure, it must first be copied (see 3copylist*,
(copylist-fun)), as you must always assume that it is one of these
special lists.  The system does not detect the error of omitting to copy
a rest-argument; you will simply find that you have a value which seems
to change behind your back.

At other times the rest-args list may be an argument that was given to
3apply*; therefore it is not safe to 3rplaca* this list as you may
modify permanent data structure.  An attempt to 3rplacd* a rest-args
list is unsafe in this case, while in the first case it would cause
an error, since lists in the stack are impossible to 3rplacd*.

.defconst lambda-parameters-limit
Has as its value the limit on the number of parameters that a lambda
list may have.  The implementation limit on the number of parameters
allowed is at least this many.  There is no promise that this many is
forbidden, but it is a promise that any number less than this many is
permitted.
.end_defconst

.subsection Lambda-List Keywords
.cindex lambda-list keywords
.cindex `&' keywords
.setq lambda-list-keywords section-page

This section documents all the keywords that may appear in the
lambda list or argument list (see (lambda-list)) of a function, a
macro, or a special form.  Some of them are allowed everywhere, while
others are only allowed in one of these contexts; those are so
indicated.  You need only know about 3&optional*, 3&key*, and
3&rest* in order to understand the documentation of system functions
in this manual.

.defconst lambda-list-keywords
The value of this variable is a list of all of the allowed `3&*' keywords.
A list of them follows.
.end_defconst

.table 3
.item &optional
Separates the required arguments of a function from the optional arguments.
See (lambda-list).

.item &rest
Separates the required and optional arguments of a function from the rest argument.
There may be only one rest argument.  See (&rest) for full information about
rest arguments.  See (lambda-list).

.item &key
Separates the positional arguments and rest argument of a function from the keyword
arguments.  See (lambda-list).

.item &allow-other-keys
In a function that accepts keyword arguments, says that keywords
that are not recognized are allowed.  They and the corresponding values are
ignored, as far as keyword arguments are concerned, but they do become
part of the rest argument, if there is one.

.item &aux
Separates the arguments of a function from the auxiliary variables.
Following 3&aux* you can put entries of the form
.lisp
(2variable* 2initial-value-form*)
.end_lisp
or just 2variable* if you want it initialized to 3nil* or don't care what the initial
value is.

.item &special
Declares the following arguments and/or auxiliary variables to be special within
the scope of this function.

.item &local
Turns off a preceding 3&special* for the variables that follow.

.item &quote
Declares that the following arguments are not to be evaluated.  This is how you create
a special function.  See the caveats about special forms on (special-form-caveat).

.item &eval
Turns off a preceding 3&quote* for the arguments which follow.

.item &list-of
This is for macros defined by 3defmacro* only.  Refer to (&list-of).

.item &body
This is for macros defined by 3defmacro* only.  It is similar to 3&rest*,
but declares to 3grindef* and the code-formatting module of the editor that
the body forms of a special form follow and should be indented accordingly.
Refer to (&body).

.item &whole
This is for macros defined by 3defmacro* only.  It means that the following
argument is bound to the entire macro call form being expanded.  Refer to
(&whole).

.item &environment
This is for macros defined by 3defmacro* only.  It means that the following
argument is bound to an environment structure which records the local
3macrolet* macro definitions in effect for subforms of the macro call form.
Refer to (&environment).
.end_table

.subsection Local Functions

The constructs 3flet* and 3labels* permit you to define
a function name in a lexical context only.  If the same name
has a global function definition, it is shadowed temporarily.
Function definitions established by 3flet* (or 3labels*)
are to global definitions made with 3defun* as lexical variable bindings
made with 3let* are to global bindings made with 3defvar*.
They always have lexical scope.

.defspec flet local-functions body...
Executes 2body* with local function definitions in effect
according to 2local-functions*.

2local-functions* should be a list of elements which look like
.lisp
(2name* 2lambda-list* 2function-body*...)
.end_lisp
just like the cdr of a 3defun* form.  The meaning of this element
of 2local-functions* is to define 2name* locally with the
indicated definition.
Within the lexical scope of 2body*, using 2name* as a function name accesses
the local definition.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(flet ((triple (x) (* x 3)))
  (print (triple -1))
  (mapcar (function triple) '(1 2 1.2)))
.end_lisp
prints the number -3 and returns a list 3(3 6 3.6)*.

Each local function is closed in the environment outside the 3flet*.
As a result, the local functions cannot call each other.
.lisp
(flet ((foo (x) (bar x t))
       (bar (y z) (list y z)))
  (foo t))
.end_lisp
calls the local definition of 3foo*, which calls the 2global* definition
of 3bar*, because the body of 3foo* is not within the scope of the
local definition of 3bar*.

Functions defined with 3flet* inside of a compiled function
can be referred to by name in a function spec of the form
3(:internal 2outer-function-name* 2flet-name*)*.
See (flet-function-spec).
.end_defspec

.defspec labels local-functions body...
Is like 2flet* except that the local functions can call each other.
They are closed in the environment inside the 3labels*, so all
the local function names are accessible inside the bodies of the
local functions.  3labels* is one of the most ancient Lisp constructs,
but was typically not implemented in second generation Lisp systems
in which no efficient form of closure existed.

.lisp
(labels ((walk (x)
	   (typecase x
	     (cons (walk (car x)) (walk (cdr x)))
	     (t (if (eq x 'haha) (print 'found-it))))))
  (walk foo))
.end_lisp
allows 3walk* to call itself recursively because 3walk*'s body
is inside the scope of the definition of 3walk*.
.end_defspec

See also 3macrolet*, an analogous construct for defining macros locally
((macrolet-fun)).

.section Some Functions and Special Forms

This section describes some functions and special forms.  Some are parts
of the evaluator, or closely related to it.  Some have to do
specifically with issues discussed above such as keyword arguments.
Some are just fundamental Lisp forms that are very important.

.defun eval form &optional nohook
3(eval 2form*)* evaluates 2form*, and returns the result.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(defvar x 43)
(defvar foo 'bar)
(eval (list 'cons x 'foo))
    => (43 . bar)
.end_lisp
The dynamic bindings available at the time 3eval* is called
are visible for dynamic variables within the expression 2x*.
No lexical bindings are available for the evaluation of 2x*.

It is unusual to call 3eval* explicitly, since usually
evaluation is done implicitly.  If you are writing a simple Lisp program and
explicitly calling 3eval*, you are probably doing something wrong.
3eval* is primarily useful in programs which deal with Lisp itself,
rather than programs about knowledge, mathematics or games.

Also, if you are only interested in getting at the dynamic value of a
symbol (that is, the contents of the symbol's value cell), then you
should use the primitive function 3symeval* (see (symeval-fun)).

If the argument 2nohook* is non-3nil*, execution of the
evalhook is inhibited for 2form*, but not for
evaluation of the subforms of 2form*.  See 3evalhook*, (evalhook-fun).
3evalhook* is also the way to evaluate in a specified lexical environment
if you happen to have got your hands on one.

Note: in Maclisp, the second argument to 3eval* is a
``binding context pointer''.  There is no such thing in Zetalisp;
closures are used instead (see (closure)).
.end_defun

.defun si:eval1 form &optional nohook
Within the definition of a special form, evaluates 2form* in the
2current* lexical environment.
.end_defun

.defun funcall f &rest args
3(funcall 2f* 2a1* 2a2* ... 2an*)* applies the
function 2f* to the arguments 2a1*, 2a2*, ..., 2an*.
2f* may not
be a special form nor a macro; this would not be meaningful.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(cons 1 2) => (1 . 2)
(setq cons 'plus)
(funcall cons 1 2) => 3
.end_lisp
This shows that the use of the symbol 3cons* as the name of a function
and the use of that symbol as the name of a variable do not interact.
The 3cons* form invokes the function named 3cons*.
The 3funcall* form evaluates the variable and gets the symbol 3plus*,
which is the name of a different function.
.end_defun

Note:  the Maclisp functions 3subrcall*, 3lsubrcall*, and 3arraycall*
are not needed on the Lisp Machine; 3funcall* is just as efficient.
3arraycall* is provided for compatibility; it ignores its first
subform (the Maclisp array type) and is otherwise identical to 3aref*.
3subrcall* and 3lsubrcall* are not provided.
'findex "subrcall"
'findex "lsubrcall"
.c 'findex "arraycall"  -- commented out since it does exist after all

.defun apply f &rest args
.defun1 lexpr-funcall f &rest args
3apply* is like 3funcall* except that the last of 2args* is
really a list of arguments to give to 2f* rather than a single argument.
3lexpr-funcall* is a synonym for 3apply*; formerly, 3apply* was
limited to the two argument case.

3(apply 2f* 2arglist*)* applies the function 2f* to the list of
arguments 2arglist*.  2arglist* should be a list; 2f* can be any function.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(setq fred '+) (apply fred '(1 2)) => 3
(setq fred '-) (apply fred '(1 2)) => -1
(apply 'cons '((+ 2 3) 4)) =>
	((+ 2 3) . 4)	2not* (5 . 4)
.end_lisp
Of course, 2arglist* may be 3nil*.

If there is more than one element of 2args*, then all but the last
of them are individual arguments to pass to 2f*, while the last one
is a list of arguments as above.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(apply 'plus 1 1 1 '(1 1 1)) => 6

(defun report-error (&rest args)
   (apply 'format *error-output* args))
.end_lisp

3apply* can also be used with a single argument.  Then this argument
is a list of a function and some arguments to pass it.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(apply '(car (a))) => a
      1;Not the same as 3(eval '(car (a)))**
.end_lisp

Note: in Maclisp, 3apply* takes two or three arguments, and the third
argument, when passed, is interpreted as a ``binding context pointer''.
So the second argument always provides all the args to pass to the function.
There are no binding context pointers in Zetalisp; true lexical scoping
exists and is interfaced in other ways.
.end_defun

.defconst call-arguments-limit
Has as its value the limit on the number of arguments that can be dealt with in a
function call.  There is no promise that this many is forbidden, but it is a promise
that any smaller number is acceptable.

Note that if 3apply* is used with exactly two arguments, the first
one being a function that takes a rest argument, there is no limit
except the size of memory on the number of elements in the second
argument to 3apply*.
.end_defconst

.defun call function &rest argument-specifications
Offers a very general way of controlling what arguments you
pass to a function.  You can provide either individual arguments as in
3funcall* or lists of arguments as in 3apply*, in any order.  In
addition, you can make some of the arguments 2optional*.  If the
function is not prepared to accept all the arguments you specify, no
error occurs if the excess arguments are optional ones.  Instead, the
excess arguments are simply not passed to the function.

The 2argument-specs* are alternating keywords (or lists of keywords)
and values.  Each keyword or list of keywords says what to do with the
value that follows.  If a value happens to require no keywords,
provide 3()* as a list of keywords for it.

Two keywords are presently defined: 3:optional* and 3:spread*.
3:spread* says that the following value is a list of arguments.
Otherwise it is a single argument.  3:optional* says that all the
following arguments are optional.  It is not necessary to specify
3:optional* with all the following 2argument-specs*, because it is
sticky.

Example:
.lisp
(call #'foo () x :spread y '(:optional :spread) z () w)
.end_lisp
The arguments passed to 3foo* are the value of 3x*, the
elements of the value of 3y*, the elements of the value of
3z*, and the value of 3w*.  The function 3foo* must be
prepared to accept all the arguments which come from 3x* and
3y*, but if it does not want the rest, they are ignored.
.end_defun

.defspec quote object
'cindex "quote"
3(quote 2object*)* simply returns 2object*.  3quote* is used to
include constants in a form.  It is useful specifically because
2object* is not evaluated; the 3quote* is how you make a form that
returns an arbitrary Lisp object.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(quote x) => x
(setq x (quote (some list)))   x => (some list)
.end_lisp
	Since 3quote* is so useful but somewhat cumbersome to type, the reader normally
converts any form preceded by a single quote (3'*) character into a 3quote* form.
.lisp
.exdent 96 For example,
(setq x '(some list))
.exdent 96 is converted by 3read* into
(setq x (quote (some list)))
.end_lisp
.end_defspec

.defspec function f
3function* has two distinct, though related, meanings.

If 2f* is a symbol or any other function spec (see (function-spec)),
3(function 2f*)* refers to the function definition of 2f*.
For example, in 3(mapcar (function car) x)*, the function
definition of 3car* is passed as the first argument to 3mapcar*.
3function* used this way is like 3fdefinition*
except that its argument is unevaluated, and so
.lisp
(function fred)  1is like*  (fdefinition 'fred)
.end_lisp

2f* can also be an explicit function, or lambda-expression, a list such
as 3(lambda (x) (* x x))* such as could be the function definition of a
symbol.  Then 3(function 2f*)* represents that function, suitably
interfaced to execute in the lexical environment where it appears.  To
explain:

.lisp
(let (a)
  (mapcar (lambda (x) (push x a)) l))
.end_lisp

.nopara
attempts to call the function 3lambda* and evaluate 3(x)*
for its first argument.  That is no way to refer to the function
expressed by 3(lambda (x) (push x a))*.

.lisp
(let (a)
  (mapcar (quote (lambda (x) (push x a))) l))
.end_lisp

.nopara
passes to 3mapcar* the list 3(lambda (x) (push x a))*.
This list does not in any way record the lexical environment
where the 3quote* form appeared, so it is impossible to make
this environment, with its binding of 3a*, available
for the execution of 3(push x a)*.  Therefore, the reference
to 3a* does not work properly.

.lisp
(let (a)
  (mapcar (function (lambda (x) (push x a))) l))
.end_lisp

.nopara
passes 3mapcar* a specially designed closure made from the
function represented by 3(lambda (x) (push x a))*.  When 3mapcar*
calls this closure, the lexical environment of the 3function* form
is put again into effect, and the 3a* in 3(push x a)* refers
properly to the binding made by this 3let*.

In addition, the compiler knows that the argument to 3function*
should be compiled.  The argument of 3quote* cannot be compiled
since it may be intended for other uses.

To ease typing, the reader converts 3#'2thing** into 3(function 2thing*)*.
So 3#'* is similar to 3'* except that it produces a
3function* form instead of a 3quote* form.  The last example
could be written as 
.lisp
(let (a)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (push x a)) l))
.end_lisp

Another way of explaining 3function* is that it causes 2f* to be
treated the same way as it would as the car of a form.  Evaluating
the form 3(2f* 2arg1* 2arg2*...)* uses the function definition
of 2f* if it is a symbol, and otherwise expects 2f* to be a list
which is a lambda-expression.  Note that the car of a form may not be
a non-symbol function spec, as that would be difficult to make sense of.
Instead, write
.lisp
(funcall (function 2spec*) 2args*...)
.end_lisp

You should be careful about whether you use 3#'* or 3'*.  Suppose
you have a program with a variable 3x* whose value is assumed to
contain a function that gets called on some arguments.  If you want that
variable to be the 3test* function, there are two things you could say:
.lisp
(setq x 'test)
.exdent 96 or
(setq x #'test)
.end_lisp
The former causes the value of 3x* to be the symbol 3test*, whereas
the latter causes the value of 3x* to be the function object found in
the function cell of 3test*.  When the time comes to call the function
(the program does 3(funcall x ...)*), either expression works
because calling a symbol as a function uses its function definition instead.
Using 3'test* is insignificantly slower, because the function
call has to indirect through the symbol, but it allows the function
to be redefined, traced (see (trace-fun)), or advised (see (advise-fun)).
Use of 3#'* picks up the function definition out of
the symbol 3test* when the 3setq* is done and does not see any later changes to it.
3#'* should be used only if you wish specifically to prevent redefinition
of the function from affecting this closure.
.end_defspec

.defun false
Takes no arguments and returns 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun true
Takes no arguments and returns 3t*.
.end_defun

.defun ignore &rest ignore
Takes any number of arguments and returns 3nil*.  This is often useful
as a ``dummy'' function; if you are calling a function that takes a function
as an argument, and you want to pass one that doesn't do anything and
won't mind being called with any argument pattern, use this.
.end_defun

.defspec comment
3comment* ignores its form and returns the symbol 3comment*.
It is most useful for commenting out function definitions
that are not needed or correct but worth preserving in the source.
The 3#|...|#* syntactic construct is an alternative method.
For comments within code about the code, it is better to use semicolons.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(comment
;; This is brain-damaged.  Can someone figure out
;; how to do this right?
(defun foo (x)
  ...)
) ;End comment
1;; prevents this definition of 3foo* from being used.*
.end_lisp
.end_defspec

.section Declarations
'cindex declaration

Declarations provide auxiliary information on how to execute a function
or expression properly.  The most important declarations are 3special*
declarations, which control the scope of variable names.  Some
declarations do not affect execution at all and only provide information
about a function, for the sake of 3arglist*, for example.

Declarations may apply to an entire function or to any expression within
it.  Declarations can be made around any subexpression by writing a
3local-declare* around the subexpression or by writing a 3declare*
at the front of the body of certain constructs.  Declarations can be
made on an entire function by writing a 3declare* at the front of the
function's body.

.defspec local-declare (declaration...) body...
A 3local-declare* form looks like

.lisp
(local-declare (2decl1* 2decl2* ...)
   2form1*
   2form2*
   ...)
.end_lisp

Each 2decl* is in effect for the forms in the body of the
3local-declare* form.
.end_defspec

.defspec declare declaration...
The special form 3declare* is used for writing local declarations
within the construct they apply to.

.need 3000
A 2declare* inside a function definition, just after the argument
list, is equivalent to putting a 3local-declare* around the function
definition.  More specifically,

.lisp
(defun foo (a b)
  (declare (special a b))
  (bar))
.end_lisp

.nopara
is equivalent to

.lisp
(local-declare ((special a b))
(defun foo (a b)
  (bar)))
.end_lisp

Note that

.lisp
(defun foo (a b)
  (local-declare ((special a b))
    (bar)))
.end_lisp

does not do the job, because the declaration is not in effect for
the binding of the arguments of 3foo*.

3declare* is preferable to 3local-declare* in this sort of
situation, because it allows the 3defun*s themselves to be the
top-level lists in the file.  While 3local-declare* might appear to
have an advantage in that one 3local-declare* may go around several
3defun*s, it tends to cause trouble to use 3local-declare* in that
fashion.

3declare* has a similar meaning at the front of the body of a
3progn*, 3prog*, 3let*, 3prog**, 3let**, or internal 3lambda*.  For
example,
.lisp
(prog (x)
      (declare (special x))
      ...)
.exdent 96 is equivalent to
(local-declare ((special x))
  (prog (x)
        ...))
.end_lisp

At top level in the file, 3(declare 2forms*...)* is equivalent to
3(eval-when (compile) 2forms*...)*.  This use of 3declare*
is nearly obsolete, and should be avoided.  In Common Lisp, 3proclaim*
(below) is used for such purposes, with a different calling convention.

Elsewhere, 3declare*'s are ignored.
.end_defspec

Here is a list of declarations that have system-defined meanings:
.table 3
.item (special 2var1 var2 ...*)
The variables 2var1*, 2var2*, etc. will be treated as special
variables in the scope of the declaration.

.item (unspecial 2var1 var2 ...*)
The variables 2var1*, 2var2*, etc. will be treated as lexical
variables in the scope of the declaration, even if they are
globally special.

.item (notinline 2fun1* 2fun2 ...*)
The functions 2fun1*, 2fun2* and so on will not be open coded
or optimized by the compiler within the scope of the declaration.

.item (inline 2fun1* 2fun2 ...*)
The functions 2fun1*, 2fun2* and so on will be open coded or
optimized by the compiler (to whatever extent it knows how) within the
scope of the declaration.  Merely issuing this declaration does not
tell the compiler how to do any useful optimization or open coding
of a function.

.item (ignore 2var1* 2var2 ...*)
Says that the variables 2var1*, 2var2*, etc., which are bound
in the construct in which this declaration is found, are going to
be ignored.  This is currently significant only in a function being compiled;
the compiler issues a warning if the variables are used, and refrains
from its usual warning if the variables are ignored.

.item (declaration 2decl1* 2decl2 ...*)
Says that declarations 2decl1*, 2decl2*, etc. are going to be used,
and prevents any warning about an unrecognized type of declaration.
For example:
.lisp
(defun hack ()
  (declare (declaration lose-method)
	   (lose-method foo bar))
  2...* (lose foo) 2...*)
.end_lisp
might be useful if 3(lose foo)* is a macro whose expander function
does 3(getdecl 'foo 'lose-method)* to see what to do.
See (getdecl-fun) for more information on 3getdecl* and declarations.
.lisp
(proclaim '(declaration lose-method))
.end_lisp
might also be advisable if you expect widespread use of 3lose-method*
declarations.
.end_table

The next two are used by the compiler and generally should not
be written by users.
.table 3
.item (def 2name*  . 2definition*)
2name* will be defined for the compiler in the scope of the declaration.
The compiler uses this automatically to keep track of macros and
open-codable functions (3defsubst*s) defined in the file being compiled.
Note that the cddr of this item is a function.

.item (2propname* 2symbol* 2value*)
3(getdecl 2symbol* 2propname*)* will return 2value*
in the scope of the declaration.  This is how the compiler keeps track of
3defdecl*s.
.end_table

These declarations are significant only when they apply to an entire 3defun*.
.table 3
.item (arglist . 2arglist*)
Records 2arglist* as the argument list of the function, to be used instead of
its lambda list if anyone asks what its arguments are.  This is
purely documentation.

.item (values . 2values*) 1or* (:return-list . 2values*)
Records 2values* as the return values list of the function, to be used if
anyone asks what values it returns.  This is purely documentation.

.item (sys:function-parent 2parent-function-spec*)
Records 2parent-function-spec* as the parent of this function.
If, in the editor, you ask to see the source of this function,
and the editor doesn't know where it is, the editor will show you
the source code for the parent function instead.

For example, the accessor functions generated by 3defstruct*
have no defuns of their own in the text of the source file.
So 3defstruct* generates them with 3sys:function-parent*
declarations giving the 3defstruct*'s name as the parent function spec.
Visiting the accessor function with 3Meta-.* sees the declaration
and therefore visits the text of the 3defstruct*.

.item (:self-flavor 2flavorname*)
Instance variables of the flavor 2flavorname*, in 3self*, will be
accessible in the function.
.end_table

.defmac locally &body body
Executes the 2body*, recognizing declarations at the front of it.
3locally* is synonymous with 3progn* except that in Common Lisp
a 3declare* is allowed at the beginning of a 3locally* and not
at the beginning of a 3progn*.

3locally* does differ from 3progn* in one context: at top level
in a file being compiled, 3progn* causes each of its elements
(including declarations, therefore) to be treated as if at top level.
3locally* does not receive this treatment.  The 3locally* form
is simply evaluated when the QFASL file is loaded.
.end_defmac

.defun proclaim &rest declarations
Each of 2declarations* is put into effect globally.  Currently only
3special* and 3unspecial* declarations mean anything in this way.
3proclaim*'s arguments are evaluated, and the values are expected
to be declarations such as you could write in a 3declare*.
Thus, you would say 3(proclaim '(special x))* to make a special
declaration globally.

Top-level 3special* declarations are not the recommended way to make a
variable special.  Use 3defvar*, 3defconstant* or 3defparameter*,
so that you can give the variable documentation.  Proclaiming the
variable special should be done only when the variable is used in a file
other than the one which defines it, to enable the file to be compiled
without having to load the defining file first.

3proclaim* is fairly new.  Until recently, top-level 3declare* was
the preferred way to make global special declarations when 3defvar*,
etc., could not be used.  Such top-level 3declare*'s are still
quite common.  In them, the declaration would not be quoted;
for example, 3(declare (special x))*.
.end_defun

.defspec special variables...
Equivalent to 3(proclaim (special 2variables*...))*, this
declares each of the 2variables* to be globally special.
This function is obsolete.
.end_defspec

.defspec unspecial variables...
Removes any global special declarations of the 2variables*.
This function is obsolete.
.end_defspec

.defmac the type-specifier value-form
Is a Common Lisp construct effectively the same as 2value-form*.  It
declares that the value of 2value-form* is an object which of type
2type-specifier*.  This is to assist compilers in generating better
code for conventional machine architectures.  The Lisp Machine does not
make use of type declarations so this is the same as writing just
2value-form*.  2type-specifier* is not evaluated.

If you want the type of an object to be checked at run time, with an
error if it is not what it is supposed to be, use 3check-type*
((check-type-fun)).
.end_defmac

.section Tail Recursion
.setq tail-recursion section-page
.cindex tail recursion

When one function ends by calling another function (possibly itself), as in
.lisp
(defun last (x)
  (cond ((atom x) x)
	((atom (cdr x)) x)
	(t (last (cdr x)))))
.end_lisp
.nopara
it is called 2tail recursion*.  In general, if 2X* is a form, and
2Y* is a sub-form of 2X*, then if the value of 2Y* is
unconditionally returned as the value of 2X*, with no intervening
computation, then we say that 2X* tail-recursively evaluates 2Y*.

In a tail recursive situation,
it is not strictly necessary to remember anything about the first call
to 3last* when the second one is activated.  The stack frame for the
first call can be discarded completely, allowing 3last* to use a
bounded amount of stack space independent of the length of its argument.
A system which does this is called 2tail recursive*.

The Lisp machine system works tail recursively if the variable
3tail-recursion-flag* is non-3nil*.  This is often faster, because
it reduces the amount of time spent in refilling the hardware's pdl
buffer.  However, you forfeit a certain amount of useful debugging
information: once the outer call to 3last* has been removed from the
stack, you can no longer see its frame in the debugger.

.defvar tail-recursion-flag
If this variable is non-3nil*, the calling stack frame is
discarded when a tail-recursive call is made in compiled code.
.end_defvar

There are many things which a function can do that can make it dangerous
to discard its stack frame.  For example, it may have done a 3*catch*;
it may have bound special variables; it may have a 3&rest* argument on
the stack; it may have asked for the location of an argument or local
variable.  The system detects all of these conditions automatically and
retains the stack frame to ensure proper execution.  Some of these
conditions occur in 3eval*; as a result, interpreted code is never
completely tail recursive.

.section Multiple Values
.cindex multiple values
.cindex returning multiple values
.setq multiple-value section-page

The Lisp Machine includes a facility by which the evaluation of a form
can produce more than one value.  When a function needs to return more
than one result to its caller, multiple values are a cleaner way of
doing this than returning a list of the values or 3setq*'ing special
variables to the extra values.  In most Lisp function calls, multiple
values are not used.  Special syntax is required both to 2produce*
multiple values and to 2receive* them.

The primitive for producing multiple values is 3values*, which takes
any number of arguments and returns that many values.  If the last form
in the body of a function is a 3values* with three arguments, then
a call to that function returns three values.  Many system functions
produce multiple values, but they all do it via 3values*.

.defun values &rest args
Returns multiple values, its arguments.  This is the primitive
function for producing multiple values.  It is legal to call 3values* with
no arguments; it returns no values in that case.
.end_defun

.defun values-list list
Returns multiple values, the elements of the 2list*.  3(values-list '(a b c))*
is the same as 3(values 'a 'b 'c)*.
2list* may be 3nil*, the empty list, which causes no values to be returned.
Equivalent to 3(apply 'values 2list*)*.
.end_defun

3return* and its variants can also be used, within a 3block*, 3do* or
3prog* special form, to return multiple values.  They are explained on
(return-fun).

Here are the special forms for receiving multiple values.

.defspec multiple-value (variable...) form
.defspec1 multiple-value-setq (variable...) form
3multiple-value* is a special
form used for calling a function which
is expected to return more than one value.
2form* is evaluated, and the 2variables*
are 2set* (not lambda-bound) to the values returned by 2form*.  If more values
are returned than there are variables, the extra values
are ignored.  If there are more variables than values returned,
extra values of 3nil* are supplied.  If 3nil* appears in the 2var-list*,
then the corresponding value is ignored (setting 3nil* is not allowed anyway).
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(multiple-value (symbol already-there-p)
	(intern "goo"))
.end_lisp
In addition to its first value (the symbol), 3intern* returns a second
value, which is non-3nil* if an existing symbol was found,
or else 3nil* if 3intern* had to create one.  So if
the symbol 3goo* was already known, the variable 3already-there-p*
is set non-3nil*, otherwise it is set to 3nil*.  The third value
returned by 3intern* is ignored by this form of call since there
is no third variable in the 3multiple-value*.

3multiple-value* is usually used for effect rather than for value; however,
its value is defined to be the first of the values returned by 2form*.

3multiple-value-setq* is the Common Lisp name for this construct.
The two names are equivalent.
.end_defspec

.defspec multiple-value-bind (variable...) form body...
This is similar to 3multiple-value*, but locally binds the variables which
receive the values, rather than setting them, and has a body--a set of forms
which are evaluated with these local bindings in effect.
First 2form* is evaluated.  Then the 2variables* are
bound to the values returned by 2form*.  Then the 2body* forms
are evaluated sequentially, the bindings are undone, and the result
of the last 2body* form is returned.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(multiple-value-bind (sym already-there)
    (intern string)
  ;; If an existing symbol was found, deallocate the string.
  (if already-there
      (return-storage (prog1 string (setq string nil))))
  sym)
.end_lisp
.end_defspec

.defspec multiple-value-call function argforms...
Evaluates the argforms, saving all of their values, and then calls
2function* with all those values as arguments.  This differs from
.lisp
(funcall 2function* 2argforms*...)
.end_lisp
because that would get only one argument for 2function* from each
2argform*, whereas 3multiple-value-call* gets as many args from each
2argform* as the 2argform* cares to return.  This works by consing a
list of all the values returned, and applying 2function* to it.  Example:
.lisp
(multiple-value-call 'append
      (values '(a b) '(c d))
      '(e f))
   =>  (a b c d e f)
.end_lisp
.end_defspec

.defspec multiple-value-prog1 form forms...
Evaluates 2form*, saves its values, evaluates the 2forms*, discards their values,
then returns whatever values 2form* produced.
This does not cons.  Example:
.lisp
(multiple-value-prog1 (values 1 2)
      (print 'foo))
   =>  1 2
.end_lisp
.end_defspec

.defspec multiple-value-list form
3multiple-value-list* evaluates 2form*, and returns a list of
the values it returned.  This is useful for when you don't know how many values
to expect.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(setq a (multiple-value-list (intern "goo")))
a => (goo nil #<Package USER 10112147>)
.end_lisp
This is similar to the example of 3multiple-value* above; 3a* is set
to a list of three elements, the three values returned by 3intern*.
.end_defspec

.defspec nth-value n form
Evaluates 2form* and returns its value number 2n*, 2n* = 0 meaning
the first value.  For example, 3(nth-value 1 (foo))* returns
the second of 3foo*'s values.  3nth-value* operates without consing
in compiled code if the first argument's value is known at compile time.
.end_defspec

When one form finished by tail recursively evaluating a subform (see
(tail-recursion)), all of the subform's multiple values are passed back
by the outer form.  For example, the value of a 3cond* is the value of
the last form in the selected clause.  If the last form in that clause
produces multiple values, so does the 3cond*.  This 2passing-back*
of multiple values of course has no effect unless eventually one of the
special forms for receiving multiple values is reached.

If the outer form returns a value computed by a subform, but not in a
tail recursive fashion (for example, if the value of the subform is
examined first), multiple values or only single values may be returned
at the discretion of the implementation; users should not depend on
whatever way it happens to work, as it may change in the future or in
other implementations.  The reason we don't guarantee non-transmission
of multiple values is because such a guarantee would not be very useful
and the efficiency cost of enforcing it would be high.  Even
3setq*'ing a variable to the result of a form, then returning the
value of that variable, might pass multiple values if an
optimizing compiler realized that the 3setq*'ing of the variable
was unnecessary.  Since extra returned values are generally ignored,
it is not vital to eliminate them.

Note that use of a form as an argument to a function never receives
multiple values from that form.  That is, if the form 3(foo (bar))*
is evaluated and the call to 3bar* returns many values, 3foo* is
still called on only one argument (namely, the first value returned),
rather than being called on all the values returned.  We choose not to
generate several separate arguments from the several values, because
this would make the source code obscure; it would not be syntactically
obvious that a single form does not correspond to a single argument.
To pass all returned values to another function, use 3multiple-value-call*, above.

For clarity, descriptions of the interaction of several common special
forms with multiple values follow.  This can all be deduced from the
rule given above.  Note well that when it says that multiple values
are not returned, it really means that they may or may not be returned,
and you should not write any programs that depend on which way it actually works.

The body of a 3defun* or a 3lambda*, and variations such as the
body of a function, the body of a 3let*, etc., pass back multiple
values from the last form in the body.

3eval*, 3apply* and 3funcall*,
pass back multiple values from the function called.

3progn* passes back multiple values from its last form.  3progv* and
3progw* do so also.  3prog1* and 3prog2*, however, do not pass
back multiple values.

Multiple values are passed back only from the last subform of an 3and* or an 3or* form,
not from previous subforms since the return is conditional.  Remember
that multiple values are only passed back when the value of a subform
is unconditionally returned from the containing form.  For example,
consider the form 3(or (foo) (bar))*.  If 3foo* returns a non-3nil*
first value, then only that value is returned as the value of the
form.  But if it returns 3nil* (as its first value), then 3or*
returns whatever values the call to 3bar* returns.

3cond* passes back multiple values from the last form in the selected
clause, provided that that last form's value is returned
unconditionally.  This is true if the clause has two or more forms in
it, and is always true for the last clause.

The variants of 3cond* such as 3if*, 3select*, 3selectq*, and
3dispatch* pass back multiple values from the last form in the
selected clause.

If a 3block* form falls through the end, it returns all the values
returned by the last expression in it.  If 3return-from* or 3return*
is used to exit a 3block* form, then the values returned by the
3block* form depend on the kind of 3return*.  If 3return* is given
two or more subforms, then 3block* returns as many values as the
3return* has subforms.  However, if the 3return* has only one
subform, then the 3block* returns all of the values returned by that
one subform.

3prog* behaves like 3block* if it is exited with 3return* (or
3return-from*).  If control falls through the end of a 3prog*, it
returns the single value 3nil*.  3do* also behaves like 3block*
with respect to 3return*, but if it is exited through the exit test,
all the values of the last 2exit-form* are returned.

3unwind-protect* passes back multiple values from its protected form.
In a sense, this is an exception to the rule; but it is useful, and it
makes sense to consider the execution of the unwind forms as a byproduct of
unwinding the stack and not as part of sequential execution.

3catch* passes back multiple values from the last form in its
body, if it exits normally.  If a throw is done, multiple values are
passed back from the value form in the 3throw*.

.defconst multiple-values-limit
The smallest number of values that might possibly fail to work.
Returning a number of values less than this many cannot possibly
run into trouble with an implementation limit on number of values returned.
.end_defconst

.section Evaluation and Function Calling Errors

Here is a description of the error conditions that the evaluator can
signal.  Some can be signaled by calls to compiled functions also.  This
is for use by those who are writing condition handlers
((condition-handlers)).  The novice should skip this section.

.defcondition sys:invalid-function (3error*)
This is signaled when an object that is
supposed to be applied to arguments is not a valid Lisp function.
The condition instance supports the
operation 3:function*, which returns the supposed function to be called.

The 3:new-function* proceed type is provided; it expects one argument,
a function to call instead.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition sys:invalid-lambda-list (3sys:invalid-function* 3error*)
This condition name is present in addition to 3sys:invalid-function*
when the function to be called looks like an interpreted function, and
the only problem is the syntax of its lambda list.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition sys:too-few-arguments (3error*)
This condition is signaled when a function is applied to too few arguments.
The condition instance supports the operations 3:function* and
3:arguments* which return the function and the list of the arguments
provided.

The proceed types 3:additional-arguments* and 3:new-argument-list*
are provided.  Both take one argument.  In the first case, the argument
is a list of arguments to pass in addition to the ones supplied.  In the
second, it is a list of arguments to replace the ones actually supplied.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition sys:too-many-arguments (3error*)
This is similar to 3sys:too-few-arguments*.  Instead of the
3:additional-arguments* proceed type, 3:fewer-arguments* is
provided.  Its argument is a number, which is how many of the originally
supplied arguments to use in calling the function again.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition sys:undefined-keyword-argument (3error*)
This is signaled when a function that takes keyword arguments is given a
keyword that it does not accept, if 3&allow-other-keys* was not used
in the function's definition and 3:allow-other-keys* was not specified
by the caller (see (allow-other-keys-kwd)).  The 3:keyword* operation
on the condition instance returns the extraneous keyword, and the
3:value* operation returns the value supplied with it.

The proceed type 3:new-keyword* is provided.  It expects one
argument, which is a keyword to use instead of the one supplied.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition-flavor sys:cell-contents-error (3error*)
This condition name categorizes all the errors signaled because of
references to void memory locations.  It includes ``unbound'' variables,
``undefined'' functions, and other things.

.table 3
.item :address
A locative pointer to the referenced cell.
.item :current-address
A locative pointer to the cell which currently contains the contents
that were found in the referenced cell when the error happened.  This
can be different from the original address in the case of dynamic
variable bindings, which move between special PDLs and symbol value
cells.
.item :cell-type
A keyword saying what type of cell was referred to: 3:function*,
3:value*, 3:closure*, or 3nil* for a cell that is not one of
those.
.item :containing-structure
The object (list, array, symbol) inside which the referenced memory cell is found.
.item :data-type
.item1 :pointer
The data type and pointer fields of the contents of the memory cell, at
the time of the error.  Both are fixnums.
.end_table

The proceed type 3:no-action* takes no argument.  If the cell's
contents are now valid, the program proceeds, using them.  Otherwise
the error happens again.

The proceed type 3:package-dwim* looks for symbols with the same name
in other packages; but only if the containing structure is a symbol.

Two other proceed types take one argument: 3:new-value* and 3:store-new-value*.
The argument is used as the contents of the memory cell.
3:store-new-value* also permanently stores the argument into the cell.
.end_defcondition-flavor

.defcondition sys:unbound-variable (3sys:cell-contents-error* 3error*)
This condition name categorizes all errors of variables whose values are void.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition sys:unbound-special-variable
.defcondition1 sys:unbound-closure-variable
.defcondition1 sys:unbound-instance-variable
These condition names appear in addition to 3sys:unbound-variable* to subcategorize
the kind of variable reference that the error happened in.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition sys:undefined-function (3sys:cell-contents-error* 3error*)
This condition name categorizes errors of function specs that are undefined.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition sys:wrong-type-argument (3error*)
This is signaled when a function checks the type of its argument and
rejects it; for example, if you do 3(car 1)*.

The condition instance supports these extra operations:
.table 3
.item :arg-name
The name of the erroneous argument.  This may be 3nil* if there is no
name, or if the system no longer remembers which argument it was.
.item :old-value
The value that was supplied for the argument.
.item :function
The function which received and rejected the argument.
.item :description
A type specifier which says what sort of object was expected for this argument.
.end_table

The proceed type 3:argument-value* is provided; it expects one argument,
which is a value to use instead of the erroneous value.
.end_defcondition
